    """Decorator for methods that issues warnings for positional arguments

    Using the keyword-only argument syntax in pep 3102, arguments after the
    ``*`` will issue a warning when passed as a positional argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    version : str
        version of the library when the positional arguments were deprecated

    Examples
    --------
    Deprecate passing `b` as positional argument:

    def func(a, b=1):
        pass

    @_deprecate_positional_args("v0.1.0")
    def func(a, *, b=2):
