pytest-xvfb
===================================

A pytest plugin to run `Xvfb`_ (or `Xephyr`_/`Xvnc`_) for tests.

----

Installation
------------

You can install "`pytest-xvfb`_" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install pytest-xvfb


Usage
-----

With Xvfb and the plugin installed, your testsuite automatically runs with `Xvfb`_. This allows tests to be run without windows popping up during GUI tests or on systems without a display (like a CI).

The plugin sees Xvfb being installed as "optional", since the tests can still
run without it installed. If it's unavailable, it will show an informational
message, if on Linux and a ``DISPLAY`` is available. When using
``--xvfb-backend xvfb``, this message will turn into a hard error instead.

If you're currently using ``xvfb-run`` in something like a GitHub Actions YAML
file simply remove the wrapper and install this plugin instead - then you'll
also have the benefits of Xvfb locally.

Features
--------

You can pass ``--no-xvfb`` to explicitly turn off Xvfb (e.g. to visually
inspect a failure).

With ``--xvfb-backend xephyr`` or ``--xvfb-backend xvnc``, you can use Xephyr
or Xvnc in place of Xvfb, e.g. to visually inspect failures.

**NOTE:** Support for ``xvnc`` is currently experimental and not tested on CI,
due to incompatibilities with PyVirtualDisplay and Ubuntu 22.04's tightvncserver.

You can mark tests with ``@pytest.mark.no_xvfb`` to skip them when they're
running with Xvfb.

A ``xvfb`` fixture is available with the following attributes:

- ``width``: The configured width of the screen.
- ``height``: The configured height of the screen.
- ``colordepth``: The configured colordepth of the screen.
- ``args``: The arguments to be passed to Xvfb.
- ``display``: The display number (as int) which is used.
- ``backend``: Either ``None`` (Xvfb), ``"xvfb"``, ``"xephyr"``, or ``"xvnc"``.

In a pytest.ini, ``xvfb_width``, ``xvfb_height``, ``xvfb_colordepth`` and
``xvfb_args`` can be used to configure the respective values. In addition,
``xvfb_xauth`` can be set to ``true`` to generate an ``Xauthority`` token.

Contributing
------------

Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with `tox`_, please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.
