pikepdf
=======

**pikepdf** is a Python library for reading and writing PDF files.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/pikepdf/pikepdf/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pikepdf/pikepdf/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pikepdf.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pikepdf/) ![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pikepdf) ![PyPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/3.9-blue) ![PyPI - License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pikepdf) ![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/pikepdf)  [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/pikepdf/pikepdf/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=8FJ755317J)](https://codecov.io/gh/pikepdf/pikepdf)

pikepdf is based on [qpdf](https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf), a powerful PDF manipulation and repair library.

Python + qpdf = "py" + "qpdf" = "pyqpdf", which looks like a dyslexia test. Say it out loud, and it sounds like "pikepdf".

```python
# Elegant, Pythonic API
with pikepdf.open('input.pdf') as pdf:
    num_pages = len(pdf.pages)
    del pdf.pages[-1]
    pdf.save('output.pdf')
```

**To install:**

```bash
pip install pikepdf
```

For users who want to build from source, see [installation](https://pikepdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

pikepdf is [documented](https://pikepdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and actively maintained. Binary wheels are available for all common platforms, both x86-64 and ARM64/Apple Silicon. For information on the latest changes, see the [release notes](https://pikepdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releasenotes/index.html).

Commercial support is available.

Features
--------

This library is similar to pypdf (formerly PyPDF2) - it provides low level access to PDF features and allows editing and content transformation of existing PDFs. Some knowledge of the PDF specification may be helpful. It does not have the capability to render a PDF to image.

Testimonials
------------

> I decided to try writing a quick Python program with pikepdf to automate [something] and it "just worked". –Jay Berkenbilt, creator of qpdf

> "Thanks for creating a great pdf library, I tested out several and this is the one that was best able to work with whatever I threw at it." –@cfcurtis

In Production
-------------

* [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) uses pikepdf to graft OCR text layers onto existing PDFs, to examine the contents of input PDFs, and to optimize PDFs.

* [PDF Arranger](https://github.com/jeromerobert/pdfarranger) is a small Python application that provides a graphical user interface to rotate, crop and rearrange PDFs.

* [PDFStitcher](https://github.com/cfcurtis/sewingutils) is a utility for stitching PDF pages into a single document (i.e. N-up or page imposition).
