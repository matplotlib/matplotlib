pyparsing module - Classes and methods to define and execute parsing grammars

The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and executing simple grammars,
vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or the use of regular expressions.  With pyparsing, you
don't need to learn a new syntax for defining grammars or matching expressions - the parsing module
provides a library of classes that you use to construct the grammar directly in Python.

Here is a program to parse "Hello, World!" (or any greeting of the form C{"<salutation>, <addressee>!"})::

    from pyparsing import Word, alphas

    # define grammar of a greeting
    greet = Word( alphas ) + "," + Word( alphas ) + "!"

    hello = "Hello, World!"
    print hello, "->", greet.parseString( hello )

The program outputs the following::

    Hello, World! -> ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']

The Python representation of the grammar is quite readable, owing to the self-explanatory
class names, and the use of '+', '|' and '^' operators.

The parsed results returned from C{parseString()} can be accessed as a nested list, a dictionary, or an
object with named attributes.

The pyparsing module handles some of the problems that are typically vexing when writing text parsers:
 - extra or missing whitespace (the above program will also handle "Hello,World!", "Hello  ,  World  !", etc.)
 - quoted strings
 - embedded comments
