========================

You can find the whole document here

THE SHORT VERSION
=================

NumFOCUS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for
everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and
expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any
form.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for NumFOCUS.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
imagery is not appropriate.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
