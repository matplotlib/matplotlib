.. _communications-guidelines:

==========================
Community management guide
==========================

These guidelines are applicable when **acting as a representative** of Matplotlib,
for example at sprints or when giving official talks or tutorials, and in any
community venue managed by Matplotlib.

Our approach to community engagement is foremost guided by our :ref:`mission-statement`:

* We demonstrate that we care about visualization as a practice
* We deepen our practice and the communityâ€™s capacity to support users,
  facilitate exploration, produce high quality visualizations, and be
  understandable and extensible
* We showcase advanced use of the library without adding maintenance burden to
  the documentation and recognize contributions that happen outside of the github
  workflow.
* We use communications platforms to maintain relationships with contributors
  who may no longer be active on GitHub, build relationships with potential
  contributors, and connect with other projects and communities who use
  Matplotlib.
* In prioritizing understandability and extensibility, we recognize that people
  using Matplotlib, in whatever capacity, are part of our community. Doing so
  empowers our community members to build community with each other, for example
  by creating educational resources, building third party tools, and building
  informal mentoring networks.

.. _communication-channels:

Official communication channels
===============================
The Scientific Python community uses various communications platforms to stay
updated on new features and projects, to contribute by telling us what is on
their mind and suggest issues and bugs, and to showcase their use cases and the
tools they have built.

The following venues are managed by Matplotlib maintainers and contributors:

* library and docs: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
* forum: https://discourse.matplotlib.org/
* chat: `https://matrix.to/#/#matplotlib:matrix.org <https://matrix.to/#/#matplotlib:matrix.org>`_
* blog: https://blog.scientific-python.org/

Maintenance
-----------

If you are interested in moderating the chat or forum or accessing the social
media accounts:

* Matplotlib maintainers should reach out to the `community-manager`_.

* Everyone else should send an email to matplotlib-social-admin@numfocus.org:

  * Introduce yourself - github handle and participation in the community.
  * Describe the reason for wanting to moderate or contribute to social.


Content guidelines
==================

Communication on official channels, such as the Matplotlib homepage or on
Matplotlib social accounts, should conform to the following standards. If you
are unsure if content that you would like to post or share meets these
guidelines, ask on the :ref:`social-media-coordination` channels before posting.

General guidelines
------------------

* Focus on Matplotlib, 3rd party packages, and visualizations made with Matplotlib.
* These are also acceptable topics:

  * Visualization best practices and libraries.
  * Projects and initiatives by NumFOCUS and Scientific Python.
  * How to contribute to open source projects.
  * Projects, such as scientific papers, that use Matplotlib.

* No gratuitous disparaging of other visualization libraries and tools, but
  criticism is acceptable so long as it serves a constructive purpose.

* Follow communication best practices:

  * Do not share non-expert visualizations when it could cause harm:

    * e.g. https://x.com/matplotlib/status/1244178154618605568

  * Clearly state when the visualization data/conclusions cannot be verified.
  * Do not rely on machine translations for sensitive visualization.

* Verify sourcing of content (especially on instagram & blog):

  * Instagram/blog: ensure mpl has right to repost/share content
  * Make sure content is clearly cited:

    * e.g. a tutorial reworking an example must credit the original example

* Limited self/corporate promotion is acceptable.

  * Should be no more than about a quarter of the content.

Visual media guidelines
-----------------------

Visual media, such as images and videos, must not violate the
:ref:`code of conduct <code_of_conduct>`, nor any platform's rules.
Specifically:

* Visual media must conform to the guidelines of all sites it may be posted on:

  * https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/x-rules
  * https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119

* Emphasize the visualization techniques demonstrated by the visual media.
* Clearly state that sharing is not an endorsement of the content.

  * e.g. bitcoin related visualizations

Accessibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Visual media in communications should be made as accessible as possible:

* Add alt text to images and videos when the platform allows:

  * `alt text for data viz <https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81>`_
  * `general alt text guide <https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/>`_

* Warn on bright, strobing, images & turn off autoplay if possible.
* For images and videos made by the social media team:

  * Make graphic perceivable to people who cannot perceive color well due to
    color-blindness, low vision, or any other reason.

  * Do not make bright, strobing images.
  * More guidelines at https://webaim.org/techniques/images/.

.. _social-media-brand:

Social media
============

Matplotlib aims for a single voice across all social media platforms to build and
maintain a consistent brand identity for Matplotlib as an organization. This
depersonalization is the norm on social media platforms because it enables
constructive and productive conversations; People generally feel more comfortable
giving negative and constructive feedback to a brand than to specific contributors.

The current Matplotlib voice and persona aims to be kind, patient, supportive and
educational. This is so that it can de-escalate tensions and facilitate
constructive conversations; being perceived as negative or
argumentative can escalate very fast into long-lasting brand damage, being
perceived as personal leads to aggression and accusations faster than an
impersonal account, and being perceived as friendly and approachable leads to
higher engagement. Instead of speaking with a directive authority, which can be
intimidating and lead to negative engagement, it speaks as a peer or educator to
empower participation. The current voice encourages more input from folks we
engage with, and also makes it possible for folks who are not in the core team
to participate in managing the account.

While the :ref:`brand identity <social-media-brand>` is casual, the showcased
content is high quality, peer-led resource building. Please follow these
guidelines to maintain a consistent brand identity across platforms.

Persona
-------
On social media, Matplotlib:

* Acts as a sentient visualization library, so talks about itself as a we, us,
  our, and it. Avoids talking about itself in the 3rd person. Never uses 1st person.
* Is very earnest, eager to please, and aims to be patient & painfully oblivious
  to snark and sarcasm.
* Gets over-excited over shiny visualizations - lots of emojis and the like -
  and encourages folks to share their work.
* Highlights various parts of the library, especially the more obscure bits and
  bobbles.
* Acknowledges that it is a sometimes frustrating tangle of bits & bobbles that
  can confuse even the folks who work on it & signal boosts their confuzzlment.


Behavior
--------
When acting as a representative of the library, keep responses polite and assume
user statements are in good faith unless they violate the :ref:`code of conduct <code_of_conduct>`.

Social graph
------------

Only follow **organizations and projects**, do not follow individual accounts for
any reason, even maintainers/project leads/famous Python people!

Following these types of accounts is encouraged:

* NumFocus and Scientific Python projects
* 3rd party packages
* Visualization related projects and organizations
* Open Source community projects
* Sponsors

Recurring campaigns
-------------------

Typically the social media accounts will promote the following:

* Matplotlib releases:

  * Highlight new features & major deprecations
  * Link to download/install instructions
  * Ask folks to try it out.

* `third party packages <https://matplotlib.org/mpl-third-party/>`_
* NumFocus/Scientific Python/open source visualization project releases
* GSOC/GSOD recruiting and progress

Retired campaigns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* John Hunter Excellence in Plotting, submission and winners


Changing the guidelines
=======================

As the person tasked with implementing these guidelines, the `community-manager`_
should be alerted to proposed changes. Similarly, specific platform guidelines
(e.g. X, Instagram) should be reviewed by the person responsible for that
platform, when different from the community manager. If there is no consensus,
decisions about guidelines revert to the community manager.
