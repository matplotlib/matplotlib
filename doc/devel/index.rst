:octicon:`heart;1em;sd-text-info` Thank you for your interest in helping to improve
Matplotlib! :octicon:`heart;1em;sd-text-info`

This project is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to contribute. Everyone
within the community is expected to abide by our :ref:`code of conduct <code_of_conduct>`.

There are various ways to contribute, such as optimizing and refactoring code,
detailing unclear documentation and writing new examples, helping the community,
reporting and fixing bugs, requesting and implementing new features...

GitHub issue tracker
====================

The `issue tracker <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues>`_ serves as the
centralized location for making feature requests, reporting bugs, identifying major
projects to work on, and discussing priorities.

We have preloaded the issue creation page with markdown forms requesting the information
we need to triage issues and we welcome you to add any additional information or
context that may be necessary for resolving the issue:

Since Matplotlib is an open source project with limited resources, we encourage users
to also :ref:`participate <contribute_code>` in fixing bugs and implementing new
features.
