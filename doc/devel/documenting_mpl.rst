   :class: multicol-toc


Getting started
===============


General file structure
----------------------

All documentation is built from the :file:`doc/`, :file:`tutorials/`, and
:file:`examples/` directories.  The :file:`doc/` directory contains
configuration files for Sphinx and  reStructuredText (ReST_; ``.rst``) files
that are rendered to documentation pages.


The main entry point is :file:`doc/index.rst`, which pulls in the
:file:`index.rst` file for the users guide (:file:`doc/users`), developers
guide (:file:`doc/devel`), api reference (:file:`doc/api`), and FAQs
(:file:`doc/faq`). The documentation suite is built as a single document in
order to make the most effective use of cross referencing.

Sphinx_ also creates ``.rst`` files that are staged in :file:`doc/api` from
the docstrings of the classes in the Matplotlib library.  Except for
:file:`doc/api/api_changes/`, these ``.rst`` files are created when the
documentation is built.

Similarly, the contents of :file:`doc/gallery` and :file:`doc/tutorials` are
generated by the `Sphinx Gallery`_ from the sources in :file:`examples/` and
:file:`tutorials/`.  These sources consist of python scripts that have ReST_
documentation built into their comments.

.. note::

  Don't directly edit the ``.rst`` files in :file:`doc/gallery`,
  :file:`doc/tutorials`, and :file:`doc/api` (excepting
  :file:`doc/api/api_changes/`).  Sphinx_ regenerates files in these
  directories when building documentation.

Installing dependencies
-----------------------

The documentation for Matplotlib is generated from reStructuredText (ReST_)
using the Sphinx_ documentation generation tool. To build the documentation
you will need to (1) set up an appropriate Python environment and (2)
separately install LaTeX and Graphviz.

To (1) set up an appropriate Python environment for building the
documentation, you should:

*  create a clean virtual environment with no existing Matplotlib
   installation
*  install the Python packages required for Matplotlib
*  install the additional Python packages required to build the documentation

There are several extra python packages that are needed to build the
documentation. They are listed in :file:`doc-requirements.txt`, which is
shown below:

.. include:: ../../requirements/doc/doc-requirements.txt
   :literal:

To (2) set up LaTeX and Graphviz dependencies you should:

*  install a minimal working LaTeX distribution
*  install the LaTeX packages cm-super and dvipng
*  install `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/download>`_

.. note::

  The documentation will not build without LaTeX and Graphviz.  These are not
  Python packages and must be installed separately.

Building the docs
-----------------

The documentation sources are found in the :file:`doc/` directory in the trunk.
The configuration file for Sphinx is :file:`doc/conf.py`. It controls which
directories Sphinx parses, how the docs are built, and how the extensions are
used. To build the documentation in html format, cd into :file:`doc/` and run:

.. code-block:: sh

   make html

Other useful invocations include

.. code-block:: sh

   # Delete built files.  May help if you get errors about missing paths or
   # broken links.
   make clean

   # Build pdf docs.
   make latexpdf

The ``SPHINXOPTS`` variable is set to ``-W --keep-going`` by default to build
the complete docs but exit with exit status 1 if there are warnings.  To unset
it, use

.. code-block:: sh

   make SPHINXOPTS= html

You can use the ``O`` variable to set additional options:

* ``make O=-j4 html`` runs a parallel build with 4 processes.
* ``make O=-Dplot_formats=png:100 html`` saves figures in low resolution.
* ``make O=-Dplot_gallery=0 html`` skips the gallery build.

Multiple options can be combined using e.g. ``make O='-j4 -Dplot_gallery=0'
html``.

On Windows, options needs to be set as environment variables, e.g. ``set O=-W
--keep-going -j4 & make html``.

.. _writing-rest-pages:

Writing ReST pages
==================

Most documentation is either in the docstring of individual
classes and methods, in explicit ``.rst`` files, or in examples and tutorials.
All of these use the ReST_ syntax. Users should look at the ReST_ documentation
for a full description. But some specific hints and conventions Matplotlib
uses are useful for creating documentation.

Formatting and style conventions
--------------------------------

It is useful to strive for consistency in the Matplotlib documentation.  Here
are some formatting and style conventions that are used.

Section name formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For everything but top-level chapters,  use ``Upper lower`` for
section titles, e.g., ``Possible hangups`` rather than ``Possible
Hangups``

Function arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Function arguments and keywords within docstrings should be referred to using
the ``*emphasis*`` role. This will keep Matplotlib's documentation consistent
with Python's documentation:

.. code-block:: rst

  Here is a description of *argument*

Do not use the ```default role```:

.. code-block:: rst

   Do not describe `argument` like this.  As per the next section,
   this syntax will (unsuccessfully) attempt to resolve the argument as a
   link to a class or method in the library.

nor the ````literal```` role:

.. code-block:: rst

   Do not describe ``argument`` like this.


.. _internal-section-refs:

Referring to other documents and sections
-----------------------------------------

Sphinx_ allows internal references_ between documents.

Documents can be linked with the ``:doc:`` directive:

.. code-block:: rst

   See the :doc:`/faq/installing_faq`

   See the tutorial :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/sample_plots`

   See the example :doc:`/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot`

will render as:

  See the :doc:`/faq/installing_faq`

  See the tutorial :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/sample_plots`

  See the example :doc:`/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot`

Sections can also be given reference names.  For instance from the
:doc:`/faq/installing_faq` link:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. _clean-install:

   How to completely remove Matplotlib
   ===================================

   Occasionally, problems with Matplotlib can be solved with a clean...

and refer to it using the standard reference syntax:

.. code-block:: rst

   See :ref:`clean-install`

will give the following link: :ref:`clean-install`

To maximize internal consistency in section labeling and references,
use hyphen separated, descriptive labels for section references.
Keep in mind that contents may be reorganized later, so
avoid top level names in references like ``user`` or ``devel``
or ``faq`` unless necessary, because for example the FAQ "what is a
backend?" could later become part of the users guide, so the label:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. _what-is-a-backend:

is better than:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. _faq-backend:

In addition, since underscores are widely used by Sphinx itself, use
hyphens to separate words.

.. _referring-to-other-code:

Referring to other code
-----------------------

To link to other methods, classes, or modules in Matplotlib you can use
back ticks, for example:

.. code-block:: rst

  `matplotlib.collections.LineCollection`

generates a link like this: `matplotlib.collections.LineCollection`.

*Note:* We use the sphinx setting ``default_role = 'obj'`` so that you don't
have to use qualifiers like ``:class:``, ``:func:``, ``:meth:`` and the likes.

Often, you don't want to show the full package and module name. As long as the
target is unanbigous you can simply leave them out:

.. code-block:: rst

  `.LineCollection`

and the link still works: `.LineCollection`.

If there are multiple code elements with the same name (e.g. ``plot()`` is a
method in multiple classes), you'll have to extend the definition:

.. code-block:: rst

  `.pyplot.plot` or `.Axes.plot`

These will show up as `.pyplot.plot` or `.Axes.plot`. To still show only the
last segment you can add a tilde as prefix:

.. code-block:: rst

  `~.pyplot.plot` or `~.Axes.plot`

will render as `~.pyplot.plot` or `~.Axes.plot`.

Other packages can also be linked via
`intersphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ext/intersphinx.html>`_:

.. code-block:: rst

  `numpy.mean`

will return this link: `numpy.mean`.  This works for Python, Numpy, Scipy,
and Pandas (full list is in :file:`doc/conf.py`).  If external linking fails,
you can check the full list of referenceable objects with the following
commands::

  python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx 'https://docs.python.org/3/objects.inv'
  python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx 'https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/objects.inv'
  python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx 'https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/objects.inv'
  python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx 'https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/objects.inv'

.. _rst-figures-and-includes:

Including figures and files
---------------------------

Image files can directly included in pages with the ``image::`` directive.
e.g., :file:`users/navigation_toolbar.rst` displays the toolbar icons
with a call to a static image::

    .. image:: ../_static/toolbar.png

as rendered on the page: :ref:`navigation-toolbar`.

Files can be included verbatim.  For instance the ``matplotlibrc`` file
is important for customizing Matplotlib, and is included verbatim in the
tutorial in :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing`::

    .. literalinclude:: ../../_static/matplotlibrc

This is rendered at the bottom of :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing`.
Note that this is in a tutorial; see :ref:`writing-examples-and-tutorials`
below.

The examples directory is also copied to :file:`doc/gallery` by sphinx-gallery,
so plots from the examples directory can be included using

.. code-block:: rst

    .. plot:: gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot.py

Note that the python script that generates the plot is referred to, rather than
any plot that is created.  Sphinx-gallery will provide the correct reference
when the documentation is built.


.. _writing-docstrings:

Writing docstrings
==================

Most of the API documentation is written in docstrings. These are comment
blocks in source code that explain how the code works.

.. note::

   Some parts of the documentation do not yet conform to the current
   documentation style. If in doubt, follow the rules given here and not what
   you may see in the source code. Pull requests updating docstrings to
   the current style are very welcome.

All new or edited docstrings should conform to the `numpydoc docstring guide`_.
Much of the ReST_ syntax discussed above (:ref:`writing-rest-pages`) can be
used for links and references.  These docstrings eventually populate the
:file:`doc/api` directory and form the reference documentation for the
library.

Example docstring
-----------------

An example docstring looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    def hlines(self, y, xmin, xmax, colors='k', linestyles='solid',
               label='', **kwargs):
        """
        Plot horizontal lines at each *y* from *xmin* to *xmax*.

        Parameters
        ----------
        y : float or array-like
            y-indexes where to plot the lines.

        xmin, xmax : float or array-like
            Respective beginning and end of each line. If scalars are
            provided, all lines will have the same length.

        colors : array-like of colors, default: 'k'

        linestyles : {'solid', 'dashed', 'dashdot', 'dotted'}, default: 'solid'

        label : str, default: ''

        Returns
        -------
        lines : `~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection`

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        **kwargs : `~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection` properties

        See also
        --------
        vlines : vertical lines
        axhline: horizontal line across the axes
        """

See the `~.Axes.hlines` documentation for how this renders.

The Sphinx_ website also contains plenty of documentation_ concerning ReST
markup and working with Sphinx in general.

Formatting conventions
----------------------

The basic docstring conventions are covered in the `numpydoc docstring guide`_
and the Sphinx_ documentation.  Some Matplotlib-specific formatting conventions
to keep in mind:

Quote positions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The quotes for single line docstrings are on the same line (pydocstyle D200)::

    def get_linewidth(self):
        """Return the line width in points."""

The quotes for multi-line docstrings are on separate lines (pydocstyle D213)::

        def set_linestyle(self, ls):
        """
        Set the linestyle of the line.

        [...]
        """

Function arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function arguments and keywords within docstrings should be referred to
using the ``*emphasis*`` role. This will keep Matplotlib's documentation
consistent with Python's documentation:

.. code-block:: rst

  If *linestyles* is *None*, the default is 'solid'.

Do not use the ```default role``` or the ````literal```` role:

.. code-block:: rst

  Neither `argument` nor ``argument`` should be used.


Quotes for strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Matplotlib does not have a convention whether to use single-quotes or
double-quotes.  There is a mixture of both in the current code.

Use simple single or double quotes when giving string values, e.g.

.. code-block:: rst

  If 'tight', try to figure out the tight bbox of the figure.

  No ``'extra'`` literal quotes.

The use of extra literal quotes around the text is discouraged. While they
slightly improve the rendered docs, they are cumbersome to type and difficult
to read in plain-text docs.

Parameter type descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main goal for parameter type descriptions is to be readable and
understandable by humans. If the possible types are too complex use a
simplification for the type description and explain the type more
precisely in the text.

Generally, the `numpydoc docstring guide`_ conventions apply. The following
rules expand on them where the numpydoc conventions are not specific.

Use ``float`` for a type that can be any number.

Use ``(float, float)`` to describe a 2D position. The parentheses should be
included to make the tuple-ness more obvious.

Use ``array-like`` for homogeneous numeric sequences, which could
typically be a numpy.array. Dimensionality may be specified using ``2D``,
``3D``, ``n-dimensional``. If you need to have variables denoting the
sizes of the dimensions, use capital letters in brackets
(``array-like (M, N)``). When referring to them in the text they are easier
read and no special formatting is needed.

``float`` is the implicit default dtype for array-likes. For other dtypes
use ``array-like of int``.

Some possible uses::

  2D array-like
  array-like (N)
  array-like (M, N)
  array-like (M, N, 3)
  array-like of int

Non-numeric homogeneous sequences are described as lists, e.g.::

  list of str
  list of `.Artist`

Referencing types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generally, the rules from referring-to-other-code_ apply. More specifically:

Use full references ```~matplotlib.colors.Normalize``` with an
abbreviation tilde in parameter types. While the full name helps the
reader of plain text docstrings, the HTML does not need to show the full
name as it links to it. Hence, the ``~``-shortening keeps it more readable.

Use abbreviated links ```.Normalize``` in the text.

.. code-block:: rst

   norm : `~matplotlib.colors.Normalize`, optional
        A `.Normalize` instance is used to scale luminance data to 0, 1.

Default values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As opposed to the numpydoc guide, parameters need not be marked as
*optional* if they have a simple default:

- use ``{name} : {type}, default: {val}`` when possible.
- use ``{name} : {type}, optional`` and describe the default in the text if
  it cannot be explained sufficiently in the recommended manner.

The default value should provide semantic information targeted at a human
reader. In simple cases, it restates the value in the function signature.
If applicable, units should be added.

.. code-block:: rst

   Prefer:
       interval : int, default: 1000ms
   over:
       interval : int, default: 1000

If *None* is only used as a sentinel value for "parameter not specified", do
not document it as the default. Depending on the context, give the actual
default, or mark the parameter as optional if not specifying has no particular
effect.

.. code-block:: rst

   Prefer:
       dpi : float, default: :rc:`figure.dpi`
   over:
       dpi : float, default: None

   Prefer:
       textprops : dict, optional
           Dictionary of keyword parameters to be passed to the
           `~matplotlib.text.Text` instance contained inside TextArea.
   over:
       textprops : dict, default: None
           Dictionary of keyword parameters to be passed to the
           `~matplotlib.text.Text` instance contained inside TextArea.


``See also`` sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sphinx automatically links code elements in the definition blocks of ``See
also`` sections. No need to use backticks there::

   See also
   --------
   vlines : vertical lines
   axhline: horizontal line across the axes

Wrapping parameter lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Long parameter lists should be wrapped using a ``\`` for continuation and
starting on the new line without any indent (no indent because pydoc will
parse the docstring and strip the line continuation so that indent would
result in a lot of whitespace within the line):

.. code-block:: python

  def add_axes(self, *args, **kwargs):
      """
      ...

      Parameters
      ----------
      projection : {'aitoff', 'hammer', 'lambert', 'mollweide', 'polar', \
  'rectilinear'}, optional
          The projection type of the axes.

      ...
      """

Alternatively, you can describe the valid parameter values in a dedicated
section of the docstring.

rcParams
~~~~~~~~
rcParams can be referenced with the custom ``:rc:`` role:
:literal:`:rc:\`foo\`` yields ``rcParams["foo"] = 'default'``, which is a link
to the :file:`matplotlibrc` file description.

Setters and getters
-------------------

Artist properties are implemented using setter and getter methods (because
Matplotlib predates the introductions of the `property` decorator in Python).
By convention, these setters and getters are named ``set_PROPERTYNAME`` and
``get_PROPERTYNAME``; the list of properties thusly defined on an artist and
their values can be listed by the `~.pyplot.setp` and `~.pyplot.getp` functions.

The Parameters block of property setter methods is parsed to document the
accepted values, e.g. the docstring of `.Line2D.set_linestyle` starts with

.. code-block:: python

   def set_linestyle(self, ls):
       """
       Set the linestyle of the line.

       Parameters
       ----------
       ls : {'-', '--', '-.', ':', '', (offset, on-off-seq), ...}
           etc.
       """

which results in the following line in the output of ``plt.setp(line)`` or
``plt.setp(line, "linestyle")``::

    linestyle or ls: {'-', '--', '-.', ':', '', (offset, on-off-seq), ...}

In some rare cases (mostly, setters which accept both a single tuple and an
unpacked tuple), the accepted values cannot be documented in such a fashion;
in that case, they can be documented as an ``.. ACCEPTS:`` block, e.g. for
`.axes.Axes.set_xlim`:

.. code-block:: python

   def set_xlim(self, ...):
       """
       Set the x-axis view limits.

       Parameters
       ----------
       left : float, optional
           The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
           limit unchanged.

           The left and right xlims may also be passed as the tuple
           (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
           the *left* keyword argument).

           .. ACCEPTS: (bottom: float, top: float)

       right : float, optional
           etc.
       """

Note that the leading ``..`` makes the ``.. ACCEPTS:`` block a reST comment,
hiding it from the rendered docs.

Keyword arguments
-----------------

.. note::

  The information in this section is being actively discussed by the
  development team, so use the docstring interpolation only if necessary.
  This section has been left in place for now because this interpolation
  is part of the existing documentation.

Since Matplotlib uses a lot of pass-through ``kwargs``, e.g., in every function
that creates a line (`~.pyplot.plot`, `~.pyplot.semilogx`, `~.pyplot.semilogy`,
etc...), it can be difficult for the new user to know which ``kwargs`` are
supported.  Matplotlib uses a docstring interpolation scheme to support
documentation of every function that takes a ``**kwargs``.  The requirements
are:

1. single point of configuration so changes to the properties don't
   require multiple docstring edits.

2. as automated as possible so that as properties change, the docs
   are updated automatically.

The function `matplotlib.artist.kwdoc` and the decorator
`matplotlib.docstring.dedent_interpd` facilitate this.  They combine Python
string interpolation in the docstring with the Matplotlib artist introspection
facility that underlies ``setp`` and ``getp``.  The ``kwdoc`` function gives
the list of properties as a docstring. In order to use this in another
docstring, first update the ``matplotlib.docstring.interpd`` object, as seen in
this example from `matplotlib.lines`:

.. code-block:: python

  # in lines.py
  docstring.interpd.update(Line2D=artist.kwdoc(Line2D))

Then in any function accepting `~.Line2D` pass-through ``kwargs``, e.g.,
`matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`:

.. code-block:: python

  # in axes.py
  @docstring.dedent_interpd
  def plot(self, *args, **kwargs):
      """
      Some stuff omitted

      The kwargs are Line2D properties:
      %(_Line2D_docstr)s

      kwargs scalex and scaley, if defined, are passed on
      to autoscale_view to determine whether the x and y axes are
      autoscaled; default True.  See Axes.autoscale_view for more
      information
      """

Note there is a problem for `~matplotlib.artist.Artist` ``__init__`` methods,
e.g., `matplotlib.patches.Patch.__init__`, which supports ``Patch`` ``kwargs``,
since the artist inspector cannot work until the class is fully defined and
we can't modify the ``Patch.__init__.__doc__`` docstring outside the class
definition.  There are some some manual hacks in this case, violating the
"single entry point" requirement above -- see the ``docstring.interpd.update``
calls in `matplotlib.patches`.


Inheriting docstrings
---------------------

If a subclass overrides a method but does not change the semantics, we can
reuse the parent docstring for the method of the child class. Python does this
automatically, if the subclass method does not have a docstring.

Use a plain comment ``# docstring inherited`` to denote the intention to reuse
the parent docstring. That way we do not accidentally create a docstring in
the future::

    class A:
        def foo():
            """The parent docstring."""
            pass

    class B(A):
        def foo():
            # docstring inherited
            pass


.. _docstring-adding-figures:

Adding figures
--------------

As above (see :ref:`rst-figures-and-includes`), figures in the examples gallery
can be referenced with a ``:plot:`` directive pointing to the python script
that created the figure.  For instance the `~.Axes.legend` docstring references
the file :file:`examples/text_labels_and_annotations/legend.py`:

.. code-block:: python

    """
    ...

    Examples
    --------

    .. plot:: gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/legend.py
    """

Note that ``examples/text_labels_and_annotations/legend.py`` has been mapped to
``gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/legend.py``, a redirection that may be
fixed in future re-organization of the docs.

Plots can also be directly placed inside docstrings.  Details are in
:doc:`/api/sphinxext_plot_directive_api`.  A short example is:

.. code-block:: python

    """
    ...

    Examples
    --------

    .. plot::
       import matplotlib.image as mpimg
       img = mpimg.imread('_static/stinkbug.png')
       imgplot = plt.imshow(img)
    """

An advantage of this style over referencing an example script is that the
code will also appear in interactive docstrings.

.. _writing-examples-and-tutorials:

Writing examples and tutorials
==============================

Examples and tutorials are python scripts that are run by `Sphinx Gallery`_
to create a gallery of images in the :file:`/doc/gallery` and
:file:`/doc/tutorials` directories respectively.  To exclude an example
from having an plot generated insert "sgskip" somewhere in the filename.

The format of these files is relatively straightforward.  Properly
formatted comment blocks are treated as ReST_ text, the code is
displayed, and figures are put into the built page.

For instance the example :doc:`/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot`
example is generated from
:file:`/examples/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot.py`, which looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    """
    ===========
    Simple Plot
    ===========

    Create a simple plot.
    """
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    # Data for plotting
    t = np.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
    s = 1 + np.sin(2 * np.pi * t)

    # Note that using plt.subplots below is equivalent to using
    # fig = plt.figure and then ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(t, s)

    ax.set(xlabel='time (s)', ylabel='voltage (mV)',
           title='About as simple as it gets, folks')
    ax.grid()
    plt.show()

The first comment block is treated as ReST_ text.  The other comment blocks
render as comments in :doc:`/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot`.

Tutorials are made with the exact same mechanism, except they are longer, and
typically have more than one comment block (i.e.
:doc:`/tutorials/introductory/usage`).  The first comment block
can be the same as the example above.  Subsequent blocks of ReST text
are delimited by a line of ``###`` characters:

.. code-block:: python

    """
    ===========
    Simple Plot
    ===========

    Create a simple plot.
    """
    ...
    ax.grid()
    plt.show()

    ##########################################################################
    # Second plot
    # ===========
    #
    # This is a second plot that is very nice

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(np.sin(range(50)))

In this way text, code, and figures are output in a "notebook" style.

Order of examples in the gallery
--------------------------------

The order of the sections of the :ref:`tutorials` and the :ref:`gallery`, as
well as the order of the examples within each section are determined in a
two step process from within the :file:`/doc/sphinxext/gallery_order.py`:

* *Explicit order*: This file contains a list of folders for the section order
  and a list of examples for the subsection order. The order of the items
  shown in the doc pages is the order those items appear in those lists.
* *Implicit order*: If a folder or example is not in those lists, it will be
  appended after the explicitly ordered items and all of those additional
  items will be ordered by pathname (for the sections) or by filename
  (for the subsections).

As a consequence, if you want to let your example appear in a certain
position in the gallery, extend those lists with your example.
In case no explicit order is desired or necessary, still make sure
to name your example consistently, i.e. use the main function or subject
of the example as first word in the filename; e.g. an image example
should ideally be named similar to :file:`imshow_mynewexample.py`.

Miscellaneous
=============

Adding animations
-----------------

There is a Matplotlib Google/Gmail account with username ``mplgithub``
which was used to setup the github account but can be used for other
purposes, like hosting Google docs or Youtube videos.  You can embed a
Matplotlib animation in the docs by first saving the animation as a
movie using :meth:`matplotlib.animation.Animation.save`, and then
uploading to `Matplotlib's Youtube
channel <https://www.youtube.com/user/matplotlib>`_ and inserting the
embedding string youtube provides like:

.. code-block:: rst

  .. raw:: html

     <iframe width="420" height="315"
       src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/32cjc6V0OZY"
       frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
     </iframe>

An example save command to generate a movie looks like this

.. code-block:: python

    ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, np.arange(1, len(y)),
        interval=25, blit=True, init_func=init)

    ani.save('double_pendulum.mp4', fps=15)

Contact Michael Droettboom for the login password to upload youtube videos of
google docs to the mplgithub account.

.. _inheritance-diagrams:

Generating inheritance diagrams
-------------------------------

Class inheritance diagrams can be generated with the
``inheritance-diagram`` directive.  To use it, provide the
directive with a number of class or module names (separated by
whitespace).  If a module name is provided, all classes in that module
will be used.  All of the ancestors of these classes will be included
in the inheritance diagram.

A single option is available: *parts* controls how many of parts in
the path to the class are shown.  For example, if *parts* == 1, the
class ``matplotlib.patches.Patch`` is shown as ``Patch``.  If *parts*
== 2, it is shown as ``patches.Patch``.  If *parts* == 0, the full
path is shown.

Example:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. inheritance-diagram:: matplotlib.patches matplotlib.lines matplotlib.text
       :parts: 2

.. inheritance-diagram:: matplotlib.patches matplotlib.lines matplotlib.text
   :parts: 2

.. _emacs-helpers:

Emacs helpers
-------------

There is an emacs mode `rst.el
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/tools/editors/emacs/rst.el>`_ which
automates many important ReST tasks like building and updating
table-of-contents, and promoting or demoting section headings.  Here
is the basic ``.emacs`` configuration:

.. code-block:: lisp

    (require 'rst)
    (setq auto-mode-alist
          (append '(("\\.txt$" . rst-mode)
                    ("\\.rst$" . rst-mode)
                    ("\\.rest$" . rst-mode)) auto-mode-alist))

Some helpful functions::

    C-c TAB - rst-toc-insert

      Insert table of contents at point

    C-c C-u - rst-toc-update

        Update the table of contents at point

    C-c C-l rst-shift-region-left

        Shift region to the left

    C-c C-r rst-shift-region-right

        Shift region to the right
