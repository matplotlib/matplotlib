Guidelines for assigning tags to gallery examples
=================================================

Why do we need tags?
--------------------

Tags serve multiple purposes.

Tags have a one-to-many organization (i.e. one example can have several tags), while the gallery structure requires that examples are placed in only one location. This means tags provide a secondary layer of organization and make the gallery of examples more flexible and more user-friendly.

They allow for better discoverability, search, and browse functionality. They are helpful for users struggling to write a search query for what they're looking for.

Hidden tags provide additional functionality for maintainers and contributors.

What gets a tag?
----------------

Every gallery example should be tagged with:

* 1+ content tags
* structural, domain, or internal tag(s) if helpful

Tags can repeat existing forms of organization (e.g. an example is in the Animation folder and also gets an ``animation`` tag).

Tags are helpful to denote particularly good "byproduct" examples. E.g. the explicit purpose of a gallery example might be to demonstrate a colormap, but it's also a good demonstration of a legend. Tag ``legend`` to indicate that, rather than changing the title or the scope of the example.

**Tag Categories** - See :doc:`Tag Glossary <tag_glossary>` for a complete list of tags.

I. API tags: what content from the API reference is in the example?
II. Structural tags: what format is the example? What context can we provide?
III. Domain tags: what discipline(s) might seek this example consistently?
IV. Internal tags: what information is helpful for maintainers or contributors?

Proposing new tags
------------------

1. Review existing tag list, looking out for similar entries (i.e. ``axes`` and ``axis``).
2. If a relevant tag or subcategory does not yet exist, propose it. Each tag is two parts: ``subcategory: tag``. Tags should be one or two words.
3. New tags should be be added when they are relevant to existing gallery entries too. Avoid tags that will link to only a single gallery entry.
4. Tags can recreate other forms of organization.

Note: Tagging organization aims to work for 80-90% of cases. Some examples fall outside of the tagging structure. Niche or specific examples shouldn't be given standalone tags that won't apply to other examples.

How to tag?

Put each tag as a directive at the bottom of the page.
