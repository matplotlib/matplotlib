List of changes to Matplotlib prior to 2015
===========================================

This is a list of the changes made to Matplotlib from 2003 to 2015. For more
recent changes, please refer to the :doc:`/release/release_notes`.

2015-11-16
    Levels passed to contour(f) and tricontour(f) must be in increasing order.

2015-10-21
    Added TextBox widget

2015-10-21
    Added get_ticks_direction()

2015-02-27
    Added the rcParam 'image.composite_image' to permit users to decide whether
    they want the vector graphics backends to combine all images within a set
    of axes into a single composite image.  (If images do not get combined,
    users can open vector graphics files in Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape and
    edit each image individually.)

2015-02-19
    Rewrite of C++ code that calculates contours to add support for corner
    masking.  This is controlled by the 'corner_mask' keyword in plotting
    commands 'contour' and 'contourf'. - IMT

2015-01-23
    Text bounding boxes are now computed with advance width rather than ink
    area.  This may result in slightly different placement of text.

2014-10-27
    Allowed selection of the backend using the :envvar:`MPLBACKEND` environment
    variable. Added documentation on backend selection methods.

2014-09-27
    Overhauled `.colors.LightSource`.  Added `.LightSource.hillshade` to allow
    the independent generation of illumination maps. Added new types of
    blending for creating more visually appealing shaded relief plots (e.g.
    ``blend_mode="overlay"``, etc, in addition to the legacy "hsv" mode).

2014-06-10
    Added Colorbar.remove()

2014-06-07
    Fixed bug so radial plots can be saved as ps in py3k.

2014-06-01
    Changed the fmt kwarg of errorbar to support the mpl convention that
    "none" means "don't draw it", and to default to the empty string, so that
    plotting of data points is done with the plot() function defaults.
    Deprecated use of the None object in place "none".

2014-05-22
    Allow the linscale keyword parameter of symlog scale to be smaller than
    one.

2014-05-20
    Added logic in FontManager to invalidate font-cache if font-family rcparams
    have changed.

2014-05-16
    Fixed the positioning of multi-line text in the PGF backend.

2014-05-14
    Added Axes.add_image() as the standard way to add AxesImage instances to
    Axes. This improves the consistency with add_artist(), add_collection(),
    add_container(), add_line(), add_patch(), and add_table().

2014-05-02
    Added colorblind-friendly colormap, named 'Wistia'.

2014-04-27
    Improved input clean up in Axes.{h|v}lines
    Coerce input into a 1D ndarrays (after dealing with units).

2014-04-27
    removed un-needed cast to float in stem

2014-04-23
    Updated references to "ipython -pylab" The preferred method for invoking
    pylab is now using the "%pylab" magic.
    -Chris G.

2014-04-22
    Added (re-)generate a simple automatic legend to "Figure Options" dialog of
    the Qt4Agg backend.

2014-04-22
    Added an example showing the difference between interpolation = 'none' and
    interpolation = 'nearest' in `~.Axes.imshow` when saving vector graphics
    files.

2014-04-22
    Added violin plotting functions. See `.Axes.violinplot`, `.Axes.violin`,
    `.cbook.violin_stats` and `.mlab.GaussianKDE` for details.

2014-04-10
    Fixed the triangular marker rendering error. The "Up" triangle was rendered
    instead of "Right" triangle and vice-versa.

2014-04-08
    Fixed a bug in parasite_axes.py by making a list out of a generator at line
    263.

2014-04-02
    Added ``clipon=False`` to patch creation of wedges and shadows in
    `~.Axes.pie`.

2014-02-25
    In backend_qt4agg changed from using update -> repaint under windows.  See
    comment in source near ``self._priv_update`` for longer explanation.

2014-03-27
    Added tests for pie ccw parameter. Removed pdf and svg images from tests
    for pie linewidth parameter.

2014-03-24
    Changed the behaviour of axes to not ignore leading or trailing patches of
    height 0 (or width 0) while calculating the x and y axis limits. Patches
    having both height == 0 and width == 0 are ignored.

2014-03-24
    Added bool kwarg (manage_xticks) to boxplot to enable/disable the
    management of the xlimits and ticks when making a boxplot.  Default in True
    which maintains current behavior by default.

2014-03-23
    Fixed a bug in projections/polar.py by making sure that the theta value
    being calculated when given the mouse coordinates stays within the range of
    0 and 2 * pi.

2014-03-22
    Added the keyword arguments wedgeprops and textprops to pie.  Users can
    control the wedge and text properties of the pie in more detail, if they
    choose.

2014-03-17
    Bug was fixed in append_axes from the AxesDivider class would not append
    axes in the right location with respect to the reference locator axes

2014-03-13
    Add parameter 'clockwise' to function pie, True by default.

2014-02-28
    Added 'origin' kwarg to `~.Axes.spy`

2014-02-27
    Implemented separate horizontal/vertical axes padding to the ImageGrid in
    the AxesGrid toolkit

2014-02-27
    Allowed markevery property of matplotlib.lines.Line2D to be, an int numpy
    fancy index, slice object, or float.  The float behaviour turns on markers
    at approximately equal display-coordinate-distances along the line.

2014-02-25
    In backend_qt4agg changed from using update -> repaint under windows.  See
    comment in source near ``self._priv_update`` for longer explanation.

2014-01-02
    `~.Axes.triplot` now returns the artist it adds and support of line and
    marker kwargs has been improved. GBY

2013-12-30
    Made streamplot grid size consistent for different types of density
    argument. A 30x30 grid is now used for both density=1 and density=(1, 1).

2013-12-03
    Added a pure boxplot-drawing method that allow a more complete
    customization of boxplots. It takes a list of dicts contains stats.  Also
    created a function (`.cbook.boxplot_stats`) that generates the stats
    needed.

2013-11-28
    Added qhull extension module to perform Delaunay triangulation more
    robustly than before.  It is used by tri.Triangulation (and hence all
    pyplot.tri* methods) and mlab.griddata.  Deprecated matplotlib.delaunay
    module. - IMT

2013-11-05
    Add power-law normalization method. This is useful for, e.g., showing small
    populations in a "hist2d" histogram.

2013-10-27
    Added get_rlabel_position and set_rlabel_position methods to PolarAxes to
    control angular position of radial tick labels.

2013-10-06
    Add stride-based functions to mlab for easy creation of 2D arrays with less
    memory.

2013-10-06
    Improve window and detrend functions in mlab, particular support for 2D
    arrays.

2013-10-06
    Improve performance of all spectrum-related mlab functions and plots.

2013-10-06
    Added support for magnitude, phase, and angle spectrums to axes.specgram,
    and support for magnitude, phase, angle, and complex spectrums to
    mlab-specgram.

2013-10-06
    Added magnitude_spectrum, angle_spectrum, and phase_spectrum plots, as well
    as magnitude_spectrum, angle_spectrum, phase_spectrum, and complex_spectrum
    functions to mlab

2013-07-12
    Added support for datetime axes to 2d plots. Axis values are passed through
    Axes.convert_xunits/Axes.convert_yunits before being used by
    contour/contourf, pcolormesh and pcolor.

2013-07-12
    Allowed matplotlib.dates.date2num, matplotlib.dates.num2date, and
    matplotlib.dates.datestr2num to accept n-d inputs. Also factored in support
    for n-d arrays to matplotlib.dates.DateConverter and
    matplotlib.units.Registry.

2013-06-26
    Refactored the axes module: the axes module is now a folder, containing the
    following submodule:

    - _subplots.py, containing all the subplots helper methods
    - _base.py, containing several private methods and a new _AxesBase class.
      This _AxesBase class contains all the methods that are not directly
      linked to plots of the "old" Axes
    - _axes.py contains the Axes class. This class now inherits from _AxesBase:
      it contains all "plotting" methods and labelling methods.

    This refactoring should not affect the API. Only private methods are not
    importable from the axes module anymore.

2013-05-18
    Added support for arbitrary rasterization resolutions to the SVG backend.
    Previously the resolution was hard coded to 72 dpi. Now the backend class
    takes a image_dpi argument for its constructor, adjusts the image bounding
    box accordingly and forwards a magnification factor to the image renderer.
    The code and results now resemble those of the PDF backend.
    - MW

2013-05-08
    Changed behavior of hist when given stacked=True and normed=True.
    Histograms are now stacked first, then the sum is normalized.  Previously,
    each histogram was normalized, then they were stacked.

2013-04-25
    Changed all instances of::

        from matplotlib import MatplotlibDeprecationWarning as mplDeprecation

    to::

        from cbook import mplDeprecation

    and removed the import into the matplotlib namespace in __init__.py
    - Thomas Caswell

2013-04-15
    Added 'axes.xmargin' and 'axes.ymargin' to rpParams to set default margins
    on auto-scaling. - TAC

2013-04-16
    Added patheffect support for Line2D objects.  -JJL

2013-03-31
    Added support for arbitrary unstructured user-specified triangulations to
    Axes3D.tricontour[f] - Damon McDougall

2013-03-19
    Added support for passing *linestyle* kwarg to `~.Axes.step` so all
    `~.Axes.plot` kwargs are passed to the underlying `~.Axes.plot` call.  -TAC

2013-02-25
    Added classes CubicTriInterpolator, UniformTriRefiner, TriAnalyzer to
    matplotlib.tri module. - GBy

2013-01-23
    Add 'savefig.directory' to rcParams to remember and fill in the last
    directory saved to for figure save dialogs - Martin Spacek

2013-01-13
    Add eventplot method to axes and pyplot and EventCollection class to
    collections.

2013-01-08
    Added two extra titles to axes which are flush with the left and right
    edges of the plot respectively.  Andrew Dawson

2013-01-07
    Add framealpha keyword argument to legend - PO

2013-01-16
    Till Stensitzki added a baseline feature to stackplot

2012-12-22
    Added classes for interpolation within triangular grids
    (LinearTriInterpolator) and to find the triangles in which points lie
    (TrapezoidMapTriFinder) to matplotlib.tri module. - IMT

2012-12-05
    Added MatplotlibDeprecationWarning class for signaling deprecation.
    Matplotlib developers can use this class as follows::

        from matplotlib import MatplotlibDeprecationWarning as mplDeprecation

    In light of the fact that Python builtin DeprecationWarnings are ignored by
    default as of Python 2.7, this class was put in to allow for the signaling
    of deprecation, but via UserWarnings which are not ignored by default. - PI

2012-11-27
    Added the *mtext* parameter for supplying matplotlib.text.Text instances to
    RendererBase.draw_tex and RendererBase.draw_text.  This allows backends to
    utilize additional text attributes, like the alignment of text elements. -
    pwuertz

2012-11-26
    deprecate matplotlib/mpl.py, which was used only in pylab.py and is now
    replaced by the more suitable ``import matplotlib as mpl``. - PI

2012-11-25
    Make rc_context available via pyplot interface - PI

2012-11-16
    plt.set_cmap no longer throws errors if there is not already an active
    colorable artist, such as an image, and just sets up the colormap to use
    from that point forward. - PI

2012-11-16
    Added the function _get_rbga_face, which is identical to _get_rbg_face
    except it return a (r,g,b,a) tuble, to line2D.  Modified Line2D.draw to use
    _get_rbga_face to get the markerface color so that any alpha set by
    markerfacecolor will respected.  - Thomas Caswell

2012-11-13
    Add a symmetric log normalization class to colors.py.  Also added some
    tests for the normalization class.  Till Stensitzki

2012-11-12
    Make axes.stem take at least one argument.  Uses a default range(n) when
    the first arg not provided.  Damon McDougall

2012-11-09
    Make plt.subplot() without arguments act as subplot(111) - PI

2012-11-08
    Replaced plt.figure and plt.subplot calls by the newer, more convenient
    single call to plt.subplots() in the documentation examples - PI

2012-10-05
    Add support for saving animations as animated GIFs. - JVDP

2012-08-11
    Fix path-closing bug in patches.Polygon, so that regardless of whether the
    path is the initial one or was subsequently set by set_xy(), get_xy() will
    return a closed path if and only if get_closed() is True.  Thanks to Jacob
    Vanderplas. - EF

2012-08-05
    When a norm is passed to contourf, either or both of the vmin, vmax
    attributes of that norm are now respected.  Formerly they were respected
    only if both were specified. In addition, vmin and/or vmax can now be
    passed to contourf directly as kwargs. - EF

2012-07-24
    Contourf handles the extend kwarg by mapping the extended ranges outside
    the normed 0-1 range so that they are handled by colormap colors determined
    by the set_under and set_over methods.  Previously the extended ranges were
    mapped to 0 or 1 so that the "under" and "over" colormap colors were
    ignored. This change also increases slightly the color contrast for a given
    set of contour levels. - EF

2012-06-24
    Make use of mathtext in tick labels configurable - DSD

2012-06-05
    Images loaded through PIL are now ordered correctly - CG

2012-06-02
    Add new Axes method and pyplot function, hist2d. - PO

2012-05-31
    Remove support for 'cairo.<format>' style of backend specification.
    Deprecate 'cairo.format' and 'savefig.extension' rcParams and replace with
    'savefig.format'. - Martin Spacek

2012-05-29
    pcolormesh now obeys the passed in "edgecolor" kwarg.  To support this, the
    "shading" argument to pcolormesh now only takes "flat" or "gouraud".  To
    achieve the old "faceted" behavior, pass "edgecolors='k'". - MGD

2012-05-22
    Added radius kwarg to pie charts. - HH

2012-05-22
    Collections now have a setting "offset_position" to select whether the
    offsets are given in "screen" coordinates (default, following the old
    behavior) or "data" coordinates.  This is currently used internally to
    improve the performance of hexbin.

    As a result, the "draw_path_collection" backend methods have grown a new
    argument "offset_position". - MGD

2012-05-04
    Add a new argument to pie charts - startingangle - that allows one to
    specify the angle offset for the first wedge of the chart. - EP

2012-05-03
    symlog scale now obeys the logarithmic base.  Previously, it was completely
    ignored and always treated as base e. - MGD

2012-05-03
    Allow linscalex/y keyword to symlog scale that allows the size of the
    linear portion relative to the logarithmic portion to be adjusted. - MGD

2012-04-14
    Added new plot style: stackplot. This new feature supports stacked area
    plots. - Damon McDougall

2012-04-06
    When path clipping changes a LINETO to a MOVETO, it also changes any
    CLOSEPOLY command to a LINETO to the initial point. This fixes a problem
    with pdf and svg where the CLOSEPOLY would then draw a line to the latest
    MOVETO position instead of the intended initial position. - JKS

2012-03-27
    Add support to ImageGrid for placing colorbars only at one edge of each
    column/row. - RMM

2012-03-07
    Refactor movie writing into useful classes that make use of pipes to write
    image data to ffmpeg or mencoder. Also improve settings for these and the
    ability to pass custom options. - RMM

2012-02-29
    errorevery keyword added to errorbar to enable errorbar subsampling. fixes
    issue #600.

2012-02-28
    Added plot_trisurf to the mplot3d toolkit. This supports plotting three
    dimensional surfaces on an irregular grid. - Damon McDougall

2012-01-23
    The radius labels in polar plots no longer use a fixed padding, but use a
    different alignment depending on the quadrant they are in.  This fixes
    numerical problems when (rmax - rmin) gets too small. - MGD

2012-01-08
    Add axes.streamplot to plot streamlines of a velocity field.  Adapted from
    Tom Flannaghan streamplot implementation. -TSY

2011-12-29
    ps and pdf markers are now stroked only if the line width is nonzero for
    consistency with agg, fixes issue #621. - JKS

2011-12-27
    Work around an EINTR bug in some versions of subprocess. - JKS

2011-10-25
    added support for \operatorname to mathtext, including the ability to
    insert spaces, such as $\operatorname{arg\,max}$ - PI

2011-08-18
    Change api of Axes.get_tightbbox and add an optional keyword parameter
    *call_axes_locator*. - JJL

2011-07-29
    A new rcParam "axes.formatter.use_locale" was added, that, when True, will
    use the current locale to format tick labels.  This means that, for
    example, in the fr_FR locale, ',' will be used as a decimal separator.  -
    MGD

2011-07-15
    The set of markers available in the plot() and scatter() commands has been
    unified.  In general, this gives more options to both than were previously
    available, however, there is one backward-incompatible change to the
    markers in scatter:

        "d" used to mean "diamond", it now means "narrow diamond".  "D" can be
        used for a "diamond".

    -MGD

2011-07-13
    Fix numerical problems in symlog scale, particularly when linthresh <= 1.0.
    Symlog plots may look different if one was depending on the old broken
    behavior - MGD

2011-07-10
    Fixed argument handling error in tripcolor/triplot/tricontour, issue #203.
    - IMT

2011-07-08
    Many functions added to mplot3d.axes3d to bring Axes3D objects more
    feature-parity with regular Axes objects.  Significant revisions to the
    documentation as well.  - BVR

2011-07-07
    Added compatibility with IPython strategy for picking a version of Qt4
    support, and an rcParam for making the choice explicitly: backend.qt4. - EF

2011-07-07
    Modified AutoMinorLocator to improve automatic choice of the number of
    minor intervals per major interval, and to allow one to specify this number
    via a kwarg. - EF

2011-06-28
    3D versions of scatter, plot, plot_wireframe, plot_surface, bar3d, and some
    other functions now support empty inputs. - BVR

2011-06-22
    Add set_theta_offset, set_theta_direction and set_theta_zero_location to
    polar axes to control the location of 0 and directionality of theta. - MGD

2011-06-22
    Add axes.labelweight parameter to set font weight to axis labels - MGD.

2011-06-20
    Add pause function to pyplot. - EF

2011-06-16
    Added *bottom* keyword parameter for the stem command.  Also, implemented a
    legend handler for the stem plot.  - JJL

2011-06-16
    Added legend.frameon rcParams. - Mike Kaufman

2011-05-31
    Made backend_qt4 compatible with PySide . - Gerald Storer

2011-04-17
    Disable keyboard auto-repeat in qt4 backend by ignoring key events
    resulting from auto-repeat.  This makes constrained zoom/pan work. - EF

2011-04-14
    interpolation="nearest" always interpolate images. A new mode "none" is
    introduced for no interpolation - JJL

2011-04-03
    Fixed broken pick interface to AsteriskCollection objects used by scatter.
    - EF

2011-04-01
    The plot directive Sphinx extension now supports all of the features in the
    Numpy fork of that extension.  These include doctest formatting, an
    'include-source' option, and a number of new configuration options. - MGD

2011-03-29
    Wrapped ViewVCCachedServer definition in a factory function.  This class
    now inherits from urllib2.HTTPSHandler in order to fetch data from github,
    but HTTPSHandler is not defined if python was built without SSL support. -
    DSD

2011-03-10
    Update pytz version to 2011c, thanks to Simon Cross. - JKS

2011-03-06
    Add standalone tests.py test runner script. - JKS

2011-03-06
    Set edgecolor to 'face' for scatter asterisk-type symbols; this fixes a bug
    in which these symbols were not responding to the c kwarg.  The symbols
    have no face area, so only the edgecolor is visible. - EF

2011-02-27
    Support libpng version 1.5.x; suggestion by Michael Albert. Changed
    installation specification to a minimum of libpng version 1.2.  - EF

2011-02-20
    clabel accepts a callable as an fmt kwarg; modified patch by Daniel Hyams.
    - EF

2011-02-18
    scatter([], []) is now valid.  Also fixed issues with empty collections -
    BVR

2011-02-07
    Quick workaround for dviread bug #3175113 - JKS

2011-02-05
    Add cbook memory monitoring for Windows, using tasklist. - EF

2011-02-05
    Speed up Normalize and LogNorm by using in-place operations and by using
    float32 for float32 inputs and for ints of 2 bytes or shorter; based on
    patch by Christoph Gohlke. - EF

2011-02-04
    Changed imshow to use rgba as uint8 from start to finish, instead of going
    through an intermediate step as double precision; thanks to Christoph
    Gohlke. - EF

2011-01-13
    Added zdir and offset arguments to contourf3d to bring contourf3d in
    feature parity with contour3d. - BVR

2011-01-04
    Tag 1.0.1 for release at r8896

2011-01-03
    Added display of ticker offset to 3d plots. - BVR

2011-01-03
    Turn off tick labeling on interior subplots for pyplots.subplots when
    sharex/sharey is True. - JDH

2010-12-29
    Implement axes_divider.HBox and VBox. -JJL

2010-11-22
    Fixed error with Hammer projection. - BVR

2010-11-12
    Fixed the placement and angle of axis labels in 3D plots. - BVR

2010-11-07
    New rc parameters examples.download and examples.directory allow bypassing
    the download mechanism in get_sample_data.  - JKS

2010-10-04
    Fix JPEG saving bug: only accept the kwargs documented by PIL for JPEG
    files. - JKS

2010-09-15
    Remove unused _wxagg extension and numerix.h. - EF

2010-08-25
    Add new framework for doing animations with examples.- RM

2010-08-21
    Remove unused and inappropriate methods from Tick classes:
    set_view_interval, get_minpos, and get_data_interval are properly found in
    the Axis class and don't need to be duplicated in XTick and YTick. - EF

2010-08-21
    Change Axis.set_view_interval() so that when updating an existing interval,
    it respects the orientation of that interval, and can enlarge but not
    reduce the interval.  This fixes a bug in which Axis.set_ticks would change
    the view limits of an inverted axis. Whether set_ticks should be affecting

2010-06-30
    Added autoscale convenience method and corresponding pyplot function for
    simplified control of autoscaling; and changed axis, set_xlim, and set_ylim
    so that by default, they turn off the autoscaling on the relevant axis or
    axes.  Therefore one can call set_xlim before plotting a line, for example,

    Change the way we do split/dividend adjustments in finance.py to handle
    dividends and fix the zero division bug reported in sf bug 2949906 and
    2123566.  Note that volume is not adjusted because the Yahoo CSV does not
    distinguish between share split and dividend adjustments making it near
    impossible to get volume adjustment right (unless we want to guess based on
    the size of the adjustment or scrape the html tables, which we don't) - JDH

    font_manager.py should no longer cause EINTR on Python 2.6 (but will on the
    2.5 version of subprocess). Also the fc-list command in that file was fixed
    so now it should actually find the list of fontconfig fonts. - JKS

2009-11-10
    Single images, and all images in renderers with option_image_nocomposite
    (i.e. agg, macosx and the svg backend when rcParams['svg.image_noscale'] is
    True), are now drawn respecting the zorder relative to other artists. (Note
    that there may now be inconsistencies across backends when more than one
    image is drawn at varying zorders, but this change introduces correct
    behavior for the backends in which it's easy to do so.)

2009-10-21
    Make AutoDateLocator more configurable by adding options to control the
    maximum and minimum number of ticks. Also add control of the intervals to
    be used for ticking. This does not change behavior but opens previously

    In an effort to simplify the backend API, all clipping rectangles and paths

2008-12-15
    Removed mpl_data symlink in docs.  On platforms that do not support
    symlinks, these become copies, and the font files are large, so the distro

    relative links are harder for the plot directive and the \*.py files are
    not so large. - JDH

    strings instead - JDH

2008-12-08
    Some of the changes Michael made to improve the output of the property
    tables in the rest docs broke of made difficult to use some of the
    interactive doc helpers, e.g., setp and getp.  Having all the rest markup
    in the ipython shell also confused the docstrings.  I added a new rc param
    docstring.hardcopy, to format the docstrings differently for hard copy and
    other use.  The ArtistInspector could use a little refactoring now since
    there is duplication of effort between the rest out put and the non-rest
    output - JDH

2008-12-08
    Updated spectral methods (psd, csd, etc.) to scale one-sided densities by a
    factor of 2 and, optionally, scale all densities by the sampling frequency.

    determine whether either or both coordinates are used when updating
    dataLim.  This is used to fix autoscaling problems that had been triggered
    by axhline, axhspan, axvline, axvspan. - EF

2008-11-11
    Update the psd(), csd(), cohere(), and specgram() methods of Axes and the
    csd() cohere(), and specgram() functions in mlab to be in sync with the
    changes to psd().  In fact, under the hood, these all call the same core to
    do computations. - RM

2008-11-11
    Add 'pad_to' and 'sides' parameters to mlab.psd() to allow controlling of
    zero padding and returning of negative frequency components, respectively.
    These are added in a way that does not change the API. - RM

    markers in figlegend. - EF

2008-09-24
    Introduce drawstyles for lines. Transparently split linestyles like

        specified using mathtext.bf, mathtext.it, mathtext.sf etc.

    Added a new example, stix_fonts_demo.py to show how to access different
    fonts and unusual symbols.  - MGD

2007-11-09
    Applied Martin Teichmann's patch 1828813: a QPainter is used in paintEvent,
    which has to be destroyed using  the method end(). If matplotlib raises an
    exception before the call to end - and it does if you feed it with bad data
    - this method end() is never called and Qt4 will start spitting error
    messages

    TRANSFORMS REFACTORING

    The primary goal of this refactoring was to make it easier to extend
    matplotlib to support new kinds of projections.  This is primarily an
    internal improvement, and the possible user-visible changes it allows are
    yet to come.

    The transformation framework was completely rewritten in Python (with
    Numpy).  This will make it easier to add news kinds of transformations
    without writing C/C++ code.

    Transforms are composed into a 'transform tree', made of transforms whose
    value depends on other transforms (their children).  When the contents of
    children change, their parents are automatically updated to reflect those
    changes.  To do this an "invalidation" method is used: when children
    change, all of their ancestors are marked as "invalid".  When the value of
    a transform is accessed at a later time, its value is recomputed only if it
    is invalid, otherwise a cached value may be used.  This prevents
    unnecessary recomputations of transforms, and contributes to better
    interactive performance.

    The framework can be used for both affine and non-affine transformations.
    However, for speed, we want use the backend renderers to perform affine
    transformations whenever possible.  Therefore, it is possible to perform
    just the affine or non-affine part of a transformation on a set of data.
    The affine is always assumed to occur after the non-affine.  For any
    transform::

        full transform == non-affine + affine

    Much of the drawing has been refactored in terms of compound paths.
    Therefore, many methods have been removed from the backend interface and
    replaced with a handful to draw compound paths.  This will make updating
    the backends easier, since there is less to update.  It also should make
    the backends more consistent in terms of functionality.

    User visible changes:

    - POLAR PLOTS: Polar plots are now interactively zoomable, and the r-axis
      labels can be interactively rotated.  Straight line segments are now
      interpolated to follow the curve of the r-axis.

    - Non-rectangular clipping works in more backends and with more types of
      objects.

    - Sharing an axis across figures is now done in exactly the same way as
      sharing an axis between two axes in the same figure::

        fig1 = figure()
        fig2 = figure()

        ax1 = fig1.add_subplot(111)
        ax2 = fig2.add_subplot(111, sharex=ax1, sharey=ax1)

    - linestyles now include steps-pre, steps-post and steps-mid.  The old step
      still works and is equivalent to step-pre.

    - Multiple line styles may be provided to a collection.

    See API_CHANGES for more low-level information about this refactoring.

2007-10-24
    Added ax kwarg to Figure.colorbar and pyplot.colorbar - EF

2007-10-19
    Removed a gsave/grestore pair surrounding _draw_ps, which was causing a
    loss graphics state info (see "EPS output problem - scatter & edgecolors"
    on mpl-dev, 2007-10-29) - DSD

2007-10-15
    Fixed a bug in patches.Ellipse that was broken for aspect='auto'.  Scale
    free ellipses now work properly for equal and auto on Agg and PS, and they
    fall back on a polygonal approximation for nonlinear transformations until
    we convince ourselves that the spline approximation holds for nonlinear
    transformations. Added unit/ellipse_compare.py to compare spline with
    vertex approx for both aspects. JDH

2007-10-05
    remove generator expressions from texmanager and mpltraits.  generator
    expressions are not supported by python-2.3 - DSD

    Made matplotlib.use() raise an exception if called after backends has been
    imported. - EF

2007-09-30
    Modified update* methods of Bbox and Interval so they work with reversed
    axes.  Prior to this, trying to set the ticks on a reversed axis failed
    with an uninformative error message. - EF

2007-09-10
    Made skiprows=1 the default on csv2rec - JDH

2007-09-09
    Split out the plotting part of pylab and put it in pyplot.py; removed
    numerix from the remaining pylab.py, which imports everything from
    pyplot.py.  The intention is that apart from cleanups, the result of
    importing from pylab is nearly unchanged, but there is the new alternative
    of importing from pyplot to get the state-engine graphics without all the
    numeric functions.  Numpified examples; deleted two that were obsolete;
    modified some to use pyplot. - EF

2007-09-08
    Eliminated gd and paint backends - EF

2007-09-06

    Fixed a bug in the embedding of Type 1 fonts in PDF.  Now it doesn't crash
    Preview.app. - JKS

2007-09-06
    Refactored image saving code so that all GUI backends can save most image
    types.  See FILETYPES for a matrix of backends and their supported file
    types.  Backend canvases should no longer write their own print_figure()
    method -- instead they should write a print_xxx method for each filetype
    they can output and add an entry to their class-scoped filetypes
    dictionary. - MGD

2007-09-05
    Fixed Qt version reporting in setupext.py - DSD

2007-09-04

    Numpification and cleanup of mlab.py and some examples - EF

2007-08-06
    Removed mathtext2

2007-07-31
    Refactoring of distutils scripts.

    - Will not fail on the entire build if an optional Python package (e.g.,
      Tkinter) is installed but its development headers are not (e.g.,
      tk-devel).  Instead, it will continue to build all other extensions.
    - Provide an overview at the top of the output to display what dependencies
      and their versions were found, and (by extension) what will be built.
    - Use pkg-config, when available, to find freetype2, since this was broken
      on Mac OS-X when using MacPorts in a non- standard location.

2007-07-30
    Reorganized configuration code to work with traited config objects. The new
    config system is located in the matplotlib.config package, but it is
    disabled by default.  To enable it, set NEWCONFIG=True in
    matplotlib.__init__.py.  The new configuration system will still use the
    old matplotlibrc files by default. To switch to the experimental, traited
    configuration, set USE_TRAITED_CONFIG=True in config.__init__.py.

2007-07-29
    Changed default pcolor shading to flat; added aliases to make collection
    kwargs agree with setter names, so updating works; related minor cleanups.
    Removed quiver_classic, scatter_classic, pcolor_classic. - EF

2007-07-26
    Major rewrite of mathtext.py, using the TeX box layout model.

    There is one (known) backward incompatible change.  The font commands
    (\cal, \rm, \it, \tt) now behave as TeX does: they are in effect until the
    next font change command or the end of the grouping.  Therefore uses of
    $\cal{R}$ should be changed to ${\cal R}$.  Alternatively, you may use the
    new LaTeX-style font commands (\mathcal, \mathrm, \mathit, \mathtt) which
    do affect the following group, e.g., $\mathcal{R}$.

    Other new features include:

    - Math may be interspersed with non-math text.  Any text with an even
      number of $'s (non-escaped) will be sent to the mathtext parser for
      layout.

    - Sub/superscripts are less likely to accidentally overlap.

    - Support for sub/superscripts in either order, e.g., $x^i_j$ and $x_j^i$
      are equivalent.

    - Double sub/superscripts (e.g., $x_i_j$) are considered ambiguous and
      raise an exception.  Use braces to disambiguate.

    - $\frac{x}{y}$ can be used for displaying fractions.

    - $\sqrt[3]{x}$ can be used to display the radical symbol with a root
      number and body.

    - $\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)$ may be used to create parentheses and other
      delimiters that automatically resize to the height of their contents.

    - Spacing around operators etc. is now generally more like TeX.

    - Added support (and fonts) for boldface (\bf) and sans-serif (\sf)
      symbols.

    - Log-like function name shortcuts are supported.  For example, $\sin(x)$
      may be used instead of ${\rm sin}(x)$

    - Limited use of kerning for the easy case (same font)

    Behind the scenes, the pyparsing.py module used for doing the math parsing
    was updated to the latest stable version (1.4.6).  A lot of duplicate code
    was refactored out of the Font classes.

    Add rc parameter pdf.inheritcolor, which disables all color-setting
    operations in the pdf backend. The idea is that you include the resulting
    file in another program and set the colors (both stroke and fill color)
    there, so you can use the same pdf file for e.g., a paper and a
    presentation and have them in the surrounding color. You will probably not
    want to draw figure and axis frames in that case, since they would be
    filled in the same color. - JKS

    WXAgg accelerator updates - KM

    WXAgg's C++ accelerator has been fixed to use the correct wxBitmap
    constructor.

    The backend has been updated to use new wxPython functionality to provide
    fast blit() animation without the C++ accelerator.  This requires wxPython
    2.8 or later.  Previous versions of wxPython can use the C++ accelerator or
    the old pure Python routines.

    setup.py no longer builds the C++ accelerator when wxPython >= 2.8 is
    present.

    The blit() method is now faster regardless of which agg/wxPython conversion
    routines are used.

2007-02-21
    Applied the PDF backend patch by Nicolas Grilly.  This impacts several
    files and directories in matplotlib:

    - Created the directory lib/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/pdfcorefonts, holding
      AFM files for the 14 PDF core fonts. These fonts are embedded in every
      PDF viewing application.

    - setup.py: Added the directory pdfcorefonts to package_data.

    - lib/matplotlib/__init__.py: Added the default parameter
      'pdf.use14corefonts'. When True, the PDF backend uses only the 14 PDF
      core fonts.

    - lib/matplotlib/afm.py: Added some keywords found in recent AFM files.
      Added a little workaround to handle Euro symbol.

    - lib/matplotlib/fontmanager.py: Added support for the 14 PDF core fonts.
      These fonts have a dedicated cache (file pdfcorefont.cache), not the same
      as for other AFM files (file .afmfont.cache). Also cleaned comments to
      conform to CODING_GUIDE.

    - lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py: Added support for 14 PDF core
      fonts.  Fixed some issues with incorrect character widths and encodings
      (works only for the most common encoding, WinAnsiEncoding, defined by the
      official PDF Reference).  Removed parameter 'dpi' because it causes
      alignment issues.

    -JKS (patch by Nicolas Grilly)

2007-02-17
    Changed ft2font.get_charmap, and updated all the files where get_charmap is
    mentioned - ES

2007-02-13
    Added barcode demo- JDH

2007-02-13
    Added binary colormap to cm - JDH

2007-02-13
    Added twiny to pylab - JDH

2007-02-12
    Moved data files into lib/matplotlib so that setuptools' develop mode
    works. Re-organized the mpl-data layout so that this source structure is
    maintained in the installation. (i.e., the 'fonts' and 'images'
    sub-directories are maintained in site-packages.)  Suggest removing
    site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data and ~/.matplotlib/ttffont.cache before
    installing - ADS

2007-02-07
    Committed Rob Hetland's patch for qt4: remove references to
    text()/latin1(), plus some improvements to the toolbar layout - DSD

---------------------------

2007-02-06
    Released 0.90.0 at revision 3003

2007-01-22
    Extended the new picker API to text, patches and patch collections.  Added
    support for user customizable pick hit testing and attribute tagging of the
    PickEvent - Details and examples in examples/pick_event_demo.py - JDH

2007-01-16
    Begun work on a new pick API using the mpl event handling framework.
    Artists will define their own pick method with a configurable epsilon
    tolerance and return pick attrs.  All artists that meet the tolerance
    threshold will fire a PickEvent with artist dependent attrs; e.g., a Line2D
    can set the indices attribute that shows the indices into the line that are
    within epsilon of the pick point.  See examples/pick_event_demo.py.  The
    implementation of pick for the remaining Artists remains to be done, but
    the core infrastructure at the level of event handling is in place with a
    proof-of-concept implementation for Line2D - JDH

2007-01-16
    src/_image.cpp: update to use Py_ssize_t (for 64-bit systems).  Use return
    value of fread() to prevent warning messages - SC.

2007-01-15
    src/_image.cpp: combine buffer_argb32() and buffer_bgra32() into a new
    method color_conv(format) - SC

    backend_cairo.py: fix draw_image() so that examples/image_demo.py now looks
    correct - SC

2007-01-11
    Added Axes.xcorr and Axes.acorr to plot the cross correlation of x vs. y or
    the autocorrelation of x.  pylab wrappers also provided.  See
    examples/xcorr_demo.py - JDH

2007-01-10
    Added "Subplot.label_outer" method.  It will set the visibility of the
    ticklabels so that yticklabels are only visible in the first column and
    xticklabels are only visible in the last row - JDH

2007-01-02
    Added additional kwarg documentation - JDH

2006-12-28
    Improved error message for nonpositive input to log transform; added log
    kwarg to bar, barh, and hist, and modified bar method to behave sensibly by
    default when the ordinate has a log scale.  (This only works if the log
    scale is set before or by the call to bar, hence the utility of the log
    kwarg.) - EF

2006-12-27
    backend_cairo.py: update draw_image() and _draw_mathtext() to work with
    numpy - SC

2006-12-20
    Fixed xpdf dependency check, which was failing on windows.  Removed ps2eps
    dependency check. - DSD

2006-12-19
    Added Tim Leslie's spectral patch - JDH

2006-12-17
    Added rc param 'axes.formatter.limits' to control the default threshold for
    switching to scientific notation. Added convenience method
    Axes.ticklabel_format() for turning scientific notation on or off on either
    or both axes. - EF

2006-12-16
    Added ability to turn control scientific notation in ScalarFormatter - EF

2006-12-16
    Enhanced boxplot to handle more flexible inputs - EF

2006-12-13
    Replaced calls to where() in colors.py with much faster clip() and
    putmask() calls; removed inappropriate uses of getmaskorNone (which should
    be needed only very rarely); all in response to profiling by David
    Cournapeau.  Also fixed bugs in my 2-D array support from 12-09. - EF

2006-12-09
    Replaced spy and spy2 with the new spy that combines marker and image
    capabilities - EF

2006-12-09

    Made pcolormesh argument handling match pcolor; fixed kwarg handling
    problem noted by Pierre GM - EF

2006-12-06
    Made pcolor support vector X and/or Y instead of requiring 2-D arrays - EF

2006-12-05
    Made the default Artist._transform None (rather than invoking
    identity_transform for each artist only to have it overridden later).  Use
    artist.get_transform() rather than artist._transform, even in derived
    classes, so that the default transform will be created lazily as needed -
    JDH

2006-12-03
    Added LogNorm to colors.py as illustrated by examples/pcolor_log.py, based
    on suggestion by Jim McDonald.  Colorbar modified to handle LogNorm.  Norms
    have additional "inverse" method. - EF

2006-12-02
    Changed class names in colors.py to match convention: normalize ->
    Normalize, no_norm -> NoNorm.  Old names are still available.  Changed
    __init__.py rc defaults to match those in matplotlibrc - EF

2006-11-22
    Fixed bug in set_*lim that I had introduced on 11-15 - EF

2006-11-22
    Added examples/clippedline.py, which shows how to clip line data based on
    view limits -- it also changes the marker style when zoomed in - JDH

2006-11-21
    Some spy bug-fixes and added precision arg per Robert C's suggestion  - JDH

2006-11-19
    Added semi-automatic docstring generation detailing all the kwargs that
    functions take using the artist introspection tools; e.g., 'help text now
    details the scatter kwargs that control the Text properties  - JDH

2006-11-17
    Removed obsolete scatter_classic, leaving a stub to raise
    NotImplementedError; same for pcolor_classic - EF

2006-11-15
    Removed obsolete pcolor_classic - EF

2006-11-15
    Fixed 1588908 reported by Russel Owen; factored nonsingular method out of
    ticker.py, put it into transforms.py as a function, and used it in set_xlim
    and set_ylim. - EF

2006-11-14
    Applied patch 1591716 by Ulf Larssen to fix a bug in apply_aspect.
    Modified and applied patch 1594894 by mdehoon to fix bugs and improve

    etc. plot full frequency range for complex inputs. - EF

2006-11-14
    Improved the ability of the colorbar to track changes in corresponding
    image, pcolor, or contourf. - EF

2006-11-11
    Fixed bug that broke Numeric compatibility; added support for alpha to
    colorbar.  The alpha information is taken from the mappable object, not
    specified as a kwarg. - EF

2006-11-05
    Added broken_barh function for making a sequence of horizontal bars broken
    by gaps -- see examples/broken_barh.py

2006-11-05
    Removed lineprops and markerprops from the Annotation code and replaced
    them with an arrow configurable with kwarg arrowprops.  See
    examples/annotation_demo.py - JDH

2006-11-02
    Fixed a pylab subplot bug that was causing axes to be deleted with hspace
    or wspace equals zero in subplots_adjust - JDH

2006-10-31
    Applied axes3d patch 1587359
    \http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1587359&group_id=80706&atid=560722

2006-10-12
    Committed Manuel Metz's StarPolygon code and examples/scatter_star_poly.py
    - JDH

2006-10-11
    commented out all default values in matplotlibrc.template Default values
    should generally be taken from defaultParam in __init__.py - the file
    matplotlib should only contain those values that the user wants to
    explicitly change from the default.  (see thread "marker color handling" on
    matplotlib-devel)

2006-10-10
    Changed default comment character for load to '#' - JDH

2006-10-10
    deactivated rcfile-configurability of markerfacecolor and markeredgecolor.
    Both are now hardcoded to the special value 'auto' to follow the line
    color. Configurability at run-time (using function arguments) remains
    functional. - NN

2006-10-07
    introduced dummy argument magnification=1.0 to FigImage.make_image to
    satisfy unit test figimage_demo.py The argument is not yet handled
    correctly, which should only show up when using non-standard DPI settings
    in PS backend, introduced by patch #1562394. - NN

2006-10-06
    add backend-agnostic example: simple3d.py - NN

2006-09-29
    fix line-breaking for SVG-inline images (purely cosmetic) - NN

2006-09-29
    reworked set_linestyle and set_marker markeredgecolor and markerfacecolor
    now default to a special value "auto" that keeps the color in sync with the
    line color further, the intelligence of axes.plot is cleaned up, improved
    and simplified. Complete compatibility cannot be guaranteed, but the new
    behavior should be much more predictable (see patch #1104615 for details) -
    NN

2006-09-29
    changed implementation of clip-path in SVG to work around a limitation in
    inkscape - NN

2006-09-29
    added two options to matplotlibrc:

    - svg.image_inline
    - svg.image_noscale

    see patch #1533010 for details - NN

2006-09-29
    axes.py: cleaned up kwargs checking - NN

    matplotlib.text.Annotation, examples/annotation_demo.py and
    examples/annotation_demo_pylab.py - JDH

2006-09-18
    mathtext2.py: The SVG backend now supports the same things that the AGG
    backend does. Fixed some bugs with rendering, and out of bounds errors in
    the AGG backend - ES. Changed the return values of math_parse_s_ft2font_svg
    to support lines (fractions etc.)

2006-09-17
    Added an Annotation class to facilitate annotating objects and an examples
    file examples/annotation_demo.py.  I want to add dash support as in
    TextWithDash, but haven't decided yet whether inheriting from TextWithDash
    is the right base class or if another approach is needed - JDH

------------------------------

2006-09-05
    Released 0.87.5 at revision 2761

2006-09-04
    Added nxutils for some numeric add-on extension code -- specifically a

    ft2font.cpp: Added draw_rect_filled method (now used by mathtext2 to draw
    the fraction bar) to FT2Font - ES

2006-08-29
    setupext.py: wrap calls to tk.getvar() with str(). On some systems, getvar
    returns a Tcl_Obj instead of a string - DSD

    Updated the mathtext2_demo.py - ES

2006-08-27
    qt backends: don't create a QApplication when backend is imported, do it
    when the FigureCanvasQt is created. Simplifies applications where mpl is
    embedded in qt. Updated embedding_in_qt* examples - DSD

2006-08-27
    mathtext2.py: Now the fonts are searched in the OS font dir and in the
    mpl-data dir. Also env is not a dict anymore. - ES

    Add compatibility for NumPy 1.0 - TEO

2006-06-29
    Added a Qt4Agg backend. Thank you James Amundson - DSD

2006-06-26
    Fixed a usetex bug. On Windows, usetex will process postscript output in
    the current directory rather than in a temp directory. This is due to the
    use of spaces and tildes in windows paths, which cause problems with latex.
    The subprocess module is no longer used. - DSD

2006-06-22
    Various changes to bar(), barh(), and hist().  Added 'edgecolor' keyword
    arg to bar() and barh().  The x and y args in barh() have been renamed to
    width and bottom respectively, and their order has been swapped to maintain
    a (position, value) order ala matlab. left, height, width and bottom args
    can now all be scalars or sequences. barh() now defaults to edge alignment
    instead of center alignment. Added a keyword arg 'align' to bar(), barh()
    and hist() that controls between edge or center bar alignment. Fixed
    ignoring the rcParams['patch.facecolor'] for bar color in bar() and barh().
    Fixed ignoring the rcParams['lines.color'] for error bar color in bar() and
    barh(). Fixed a bug where patches would be cleared when error bars were
    plotted if rcParams['axes.hold'] was False. - MAS

2006-06-22
    Added support for numerix 2-D arrays as alternatives to a sequence of (x,y)
    tuples for specifying paths in collections, quiver, contour, pcolor,
    transforms.  Fixed contour bug involving setting limits for colormapping.
    Added numpy-style all() to numerix. - EF

    gist_yarg, gist_heat, gist_ncar) - JW

2006-06-16
    Added a pointer to parent in figure canvas so you can access the container
    with fig.canvas.manager.  Useful if you want to set the window title, e.g.,
    in gtk fig.canvas.manager.window.set_title, though a GUI neutral method
    would be preferable JDH

2006-06-16
    Fixed colorbar.py to handle indexed colors (i.e., norm = no_norm()) by
    centering each colored region on its index. - EF

2006-06-15
    Added scalex and scaley to Axes.autoscale_view to support selective
    autoscaling just the x or y axis, and supported these command in plot so
    you can say plot(something, scaley=False) and just the x axis will be
    autoscaled.  Modified axvline and axhline to support this, so for example
    axvline will no longer autoscale the y axis. JDH

2006-06-13
    Fix so numpy updates are backward compatible - TEO

    Added quiverkey command to pylab and Axes, using QuiverKey class in
    quiver.py.  Changed pylab and Axes to use quiver2 if possible, but drop
    back to the newly-renamed quiver_classic if necessary.  Modified
    examples/quiver_demo.py to illustrate the new quiver and quiverkey.
    Changed LineCollection implementation slightly to improve compatibility
    with PolyCollection. - EF

2006-06-11
    Fixed a usetex bug for windows, running latex on files with spaces in their
    names or paths was failing - DSD

2006-06-09
    Made additions to numerix, changes to quiver to make it work with all
    numeric flavors. - EF

2006-06-09
    Added quiver2 function to pylab and method to axes, with implementation via
    a Quiver class in quiver.py.  quiver2 will replace quiver before the next
    release; it is placed alongside it initially to facilitate testing and
    transition. See also examples/quiver2_demo.py. - EF

    Multiple changes in cm.py, colors.py, figure.py, image.py, contour.py,
    contour_demo.py; new _cm.py, examples/image_masked.py.

    1. Separated the color table data from cm.py out into a new file, _cm.py,
       to make it easier to find the actual code in cm.py and to add new
       colormaps.  Also added some line breaks to the color data dictionaries.
       Everything from _cm.py is imported by cm.py, so the split should be
       transparent.
    2. Enabled automatic generation of a colormap from a list of colors in
       contour; see modified examples/contour_demo.py.
    3. Support for imshow of a masked array, with the ability to specify colors
       (or no color at all) for masked regions, and for regions that are above
       or below the normally mapped region.  See examples/image_masked.py.
    4. In support of the above, added two new classes, ListedColormap, and
       no_norm, to colors.py, and modified the Colormap class to include common
       functionality. Added a clip kwarg to the normalize class.  Reworked
       color handling in contour.py, especially in the ContourLabeller mixin.

    pressed (fixes bug report from Niklas Volbers) - SC

2005-07-24
    backend_gtk.py: modify print_figure() use own pixmap, fixing problems where
    print_figure() overwrites the display pixmap.  return False from all

    Added Eric's MA set_xdata Line2D fix - JDH

2005-07-06
    Made HOME/.matplotlib the new config dir where the matplotlibrc file, the
    ttf.cache, and the tex.cache live.  The new default filenames in
    .matplotlib have no leading dot and are not hidden.  e.g., the new names
    are matplotlibrc tex.cache ttffont.cache.  This is how ipython does it so
    it must be right.  If old files are found, a warning is issued and they are
    moved to the new location.  Also fixed texmanager to put all files,
    including temp files in ~/.matplotlib/tex.cache, which allows you to usetex
    in non-writable dirs.

2005-07-05
    Fixed bug #1231611 in subplots adjust layout.  The problem was that the
    text caching mechanism was not using the transformation affine in the key.
    - JDH

2005-07-05
    Fixed default backend import problem when using API (SF bug # 1209354 -

    Added 10.4 support for CocoaAgg. - CM

2005-06-18
    Move Figure.get_width_height() to FigureCanvasBase and return int instead
    of float. - SC

2005-06-18
    Applied Ted Drain's QtAgg patch: 1) Changed the toolbar to be a horizontal
    bar of push buttons instead of a QToolbar and updated the layout algorithms
    in the main window accordingly.  This eliminates the ability to drag and
    drop the toolbar and detach it from the window.  2) Updated the resize
    algorithm in the main window to show the correct size for the plot widget
    as requested.  This works almost correctly right now.  It looks to me like
    the final size of the widget is off by the border of the main window but I
    haven't figured out a way to get that information yet.  We could just add a
    small margin to the new size but that seems a little hacky.  3) Changed the
    x/y location label to be in the toolbar like the Tk backend instead of as a
    status line at the bottom of the widget.  4) Changed the toolbar pixmaps to
    use the ppm files instead of the png files.  I noticed that the Tk backend
    buttons looked much nicer and it uses the ppm files so I switched them.

2005-06-17
    Modified the gtk backend to not queue mouse motion events.  This allows for
    live updates when dragging a slider. - CM

2005-06-17
    Added starter CocoaAgg backend.  Only works on OS 10.3 for now and requires
    PyObjC.  (10.4 is high priority) - CM

2005-06-17
    Upgraded pyparsing and applied Paul McGuire's suggestions for speeding
    things up.  This more than doubles the speed of mathtext in my simple
    tests. JDH

2005-06-16
    Applied David Cooke's subplot make_key patch

----------------------------------

0.82 (2005-06-15)
-----------------

2005-06-15
    Added subplot config tool to GTK* backends -- note you must now import the
    NavigationToolbar2 from your backend of choice rather than from backend_gtk
    because it needs to know about the backend specific canvas -- see
    examples/embedding_in_gtk2.py.  Ditto for wx backend -- see
    examples/embedding_in_wxagg.py

2005-06-15
    backend_cairo.py: updated to use pycairo 0.5.0 - SC

2005-06-14

    in matplotlib.widgets.  See examples/widgets/\*.py - JDH

2005-06-14
    Exposed subplot parameters as rc vars and as the fig SubplotParams instance
    subplotpars.  See figure.SubplotParams, figure.Figure.subplots_adjust and
    the pylab method subplots_adjust and examples/subplots_adjust.py .  Also
    added a GUI neutral widget for adjusting subplots, see
    examples/subplot_toolbar.py - JDH

2005-06-13
    Exposed cap and join style for lines with new rc params and line properties::

        lines.dash_joinstyle : miter        # miter|round|bevel
        lines.dash_capstyle : butt          # butt|round|projecting
        lines.solid_joinstyle : miter       # miter|round|bevel
        lines.solid_capstyle : projecting   # butt|round|projecting

2005-06-05
    Fixed a TeX/LaTeX font discrepancy in backend_ps. - DSD

2005-06-05
    Added a ps.distill option in rc settings. If True, postscript output will
    be distilled using ghostscript, which should trim the file size and allow
    it to load more quickly. Hopefully this will address the issue of large ps
    files due to font definitions. Tested with gnu-ghostscript-8.16. - DSD

2005-06-03
    Improved support for tex handling of text in backend_ps. - DSD

2005-06-03
    Added rc options to render text with tex or latex, and to select the latex

    Applied Eric's cntr patch - JDH

2005-05-27
    Finally found the pesky agg bug (which Maxim was kind enough to fix within
    hours) that was causing a segfault in the win32 cached marker drawing.  Now
    windows users can get the enormous performance benefits of cached markers
    w/o those occasional pesy screenshots. - JDH

2005-05-27
    Got win32 build system working again, using a more recent version of gtk
    and pygtk in the win32 build, gtk 2.6 from
    https://web.archive.org/web/20050527002647/https://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html
    (you will also need libpng12.dll to use these).  I haven't tested whether
    this binary build of mpl for win32 will work with older gtk runtimes, so
    you may need to upgrade.

2005-05-27
    Fixed bug where 2nd wxapp could be started if using wxagg backend. - ADS

2005-05-26
    Added Daishi text with dash patch -- see examples/dashtick.py

2005-05-26
    Moved backend_latex functionality into backend_ps. If text.usetex=True, the
    PostScript backend will use LaTeX to generate the .ps or .eps file.
    Ghostscript is required for eps output. - DSD

2005-05-24
    Fixed alignment and color issues in latex backend. - DSD

2005-05-21
    Fixed raster problem for small rasters with dvipng -- looks like it was a
    premultiplied alpha problem - JDH

2005-05-20

    color.  Also added autolegend patch to inspect line segments.

2005-05-18
    Added Orsay and JPL qt fixes - JDH

2005-05-17
    Added a psfrag latex backend -- some alignment issues need to be worked
    out. Run with -dLaTeX and a *.tex file and *.eps file are generated.  latex
    and dvips the generated latex file to get ps output.  Note xdvi *does* not
    work, you must generate ps.- JDH

2005-05-13
    Added Florent Rougon's Axis set_label1 patch

2005-05-17
    pcolor optimization, fixed bug in previous pcolor patch - JSWHIT

2005-05-16
    Added support for masked arrays in pcolor - JSWHIT


2005-05-12
    Started work on TeX text for antigrain using pngdvi -- see
    examples/tex_demo.py and the new module matplotlib.texmanager.  Rotated
    text not supported and rendering small glyphs is not working right yet.  But
    large fontsizes and/or high dpi saved figs work great.

2005-05-10
    New image resize options interpolation options.  New values for the interp
    kwarg are

           'nearest', 'bilinear', 'bicubic', 'spline16', 'spline36',
           'hanning', 'hamming', 'hermite', 'kaiser', 'quadric',
           'catrom', 'gaussian', 'bessel', 'mitchell', 'sinc',
           'lanczos', 'blackman'

    See help(imshow) for details, particularly the interpolation, filternorm
    and filterrad kwargs


2005-05-10
    Applied Eric's contour mem leak fixes - JDH

2005-05-10
    Extended python agg wrapper and started implementing backend_agg2, an agg
    renderer based on the python wrapper.  This will be more flexible and
    easier to extend than the current backend_agg.  See also
    examples/agg_test.py - JDH

2005-05-09
    Added Marcin's no legend patch to exclude lines from the autolegend builder::

           plot(x, y, label='nolegend')

    notation, and the ability to plot large numbers with small ranges, by
    determining a numerical offset.  See ticker.NewScalarFormatter for more
    details. -DSD

2005-05-03
    Added the option to specify a delimiter in pylab.load -DSD

2005-04-14
    Applied Michael Brady's qt backend patch: 1) fix a bug where keyboard input
    was grabbed by the figure and not released  2) turn on cursor changes  3)
    clean up a typo and commented-out print statement. - JDH

2005-04-14
    Applied Eric Firing's masked data lines patch and contour patch.  Support
    for masked arrays has been added to the plot command and to the Line2D
    object.  Only the valid points are plotted.  A "valid_only" kwarg was added
    to the get_xdata() and get_ydata() methods of Line2D; by default it is
    False, so that the original data arrays are returned. Setting it to True
    returns the plottable points.  - see examples/masked_demo.py - JDH

2005-04-13
    Applied Tim Leslie's arrow key event handling patch - JDH

---------------------------

0.80
----

2005-04-11
    Applied a variant of rick's xlim/ylim/axis patch.  These functions now take
    kwargs to let you selectively alter only the min or max if desired.  e.g.,
    xlim(xmin=2) or axis(ymax=3).  They always return the new lim. - JDH


2005-04-11
    Incorporated Werner's wx patch -- wx backend should be compatible with
    wxpython2.4 and recent versions of 2.5.  Some early versions of wxpython
    2.5 will not work because there was a temporary change in the dc API that
    was rolled back to make it 2.4 compliant

2005-04-11
    modified tkagg show so that new figure window pops up on call to figure

2005-04-11

    Fixed tick on horiz colorbar - JDH

2005-03-16
    Added Japanese winreg patch - JDH

2005-03-15
    backend_gtkagg.py: changed to use double buffering, this fixes the problem
    reported Joachim Berdal Haga - "Parts of plot lagging from previous frame
    in animation". Tested with anim.py and it makes no noticeable difference to
    performance (23.7 before, 23.6 after) - SC

2005-03-14
    add src/_backend_gdk.c extension to provide a substitute function for
    pixbuf.get_pixels_array(). Currently pixbuf.get_pixels_array() only works
    with Numeric, and then only works if pygtk has been compiled with Numeric
    support. The change provides a function pixbuf_get_pixels_array() which
    works with Numeric and numarray and is always available. It means that
    backend_gtk should be able to display images and mathtext in all
    circumstances. - SC

2005-03-11
    Upgraded CXX to 5.3.1

2005-03-10
    remove GraphicsContextPS.set_linestyle() and
    GraphicsContextSVG.set_linestyle() since they do no more than the base
    class GraphicsContext.set_linestyle() - SC

2005-03-09
    Refactored contour functionality into dedicated module

2005-03-09
    Added Eric's contourf updates and Nadia's clabel functionality

2005-03-09
    Moved colorbar to figure.Figure to expose it for API developers - JDH

2005-03-09
    backend_cairo.py: implemented draw_markers() - SC

2005-03-09
    cbook.py: only use enumerate() (the python version) if the builtin version
    is not available.  Add new function 'izip' which is set to itertools.izip
    if available and the python equivalent if not available. - SC

2005-03-07
    backend_gdk.py: remove PIXELS_PER_INCH from points_to_pixels(), but still
    use it to adjust font sizes. This allows the GTK version of line_styles.py
    to more closely match GTKAgg, previously the markers were being drawn too
    large. - SC

2005-03-01
    Added Eric's contourf routines

2005-03-01
    Added start of proper agg SWIG wrapper.  I would like to expose agg
    functionality directly a the user level and this module will serve that
    purpose eventually, and will hopefully take over most of the functionality
    of the current _image and _backend_agg modules.  - JDH

2005-02-28
    Fixed polyfit / polyval to convert input args to float arrays - JDH

2005-02-25
    Add experimental feature to backend_gtk.py to enable/disable double
    buffering (DBL_BUFFER=True/False) - SC

2005-02-24
    colors.py change ColorConverter.to_rgb() so it always returns rgb (and not
    rgba), allow cnames keys to be cached, change the exception raised from
    RuntimeError to ValueError (like hex2color()) hex2color() use a regular
    expression to check the color string is valid  - SC

2005-02-23
    Added rc param ps.useafm so backend ps can use native afm fonts or
    truetype.  afme breaks mathtext but causes much smaller font sizes and may
    result in images that display better in some contexts (e.g., pdfs
    incorporated into latex docs viewed in acrobat reader).  I would like to
    extend this approach to allow the user to use truetype only for mathtext,
    which should be easy.

2005-02-23
    Used sequence protocol rather than tuple in agg collection drawing routines
    for greater flexibility - JDH

--------------------------------

0.72.1 (2005-02-22)
-------------------

2005-02-21
    fixed linestyles for collections -- contour now dashes for levels <0

2005-02-21
    fixed ps color bug - JDH

2005-02-15
    fixed missing qt file

2005-02-15
    banished error_msg and report_error.  Internal backend methods like
    error_msg_gtk are preserved.  backend writers, check your backends, and
    diff against 0.72 to make sure I did the right thing! - JDH

2005-02-14
    Added enthought traits to matplotlib tree - JDH

------------------------

    backend renderer draw_lines now has transform in backend, as in
    draw_markers; use numerix in _backend_agg, added small line optimization to
    agg

2005-02-09
    subplot now deletes axes that it overlaps

2005-02-08
    Added transparent support for gzipped files in load/save - Fernando Perez
    (FP from now on).

2005-02-08
    Small optimizations in PS backend.  They may have a big impact for large
    plots, otherwise they don't hurt  - FP

    Added some support for handling log switching for lines that have nonpos
    data - JDH

2005-02-04

    contour - JDH

2005-01-19
    Restored builtin names which were overridden (min, max, abs, round, and
    sum) in pylab.  This is a potentially significant change for those who were
    relying on an array version of those functions that previously overrode
    builtin function names. - ADS

2005-01-18
    Added accents to mathtext: \hat, \breve, \grave, \bar, \acute, \tilde,
    \vec, \dot, \ddot.  All of them have the same syntax, e.g., to make an

    Fixed coords notification in wx toolbar - JDH

2004-12-28
    Moved connection and disconnection event handling to the FigureCanvasBase.
    Backends now only need to connect one time for each of the button press,
    button release and key press/release functions.  The base class deals with
    callbacks and multiple connections.  This fixes flakiness on some backends
    (tk, wx) in the presence of multiple connections and/or disconnect - JDH

2004-12-27
    Fixed PS mathtext bug where color was not set - Jochen please verify
    correct - JDH

    takes (canvas, window) rather than (canvas, figman) - JDH

2004-12-21
    Refactored axes and subplot management - removed add_subplot and add_axes
    from the FigureManager.  classic toolbar updates are done via an observer
    pattern on the figure using add_axobserver.  Figure now maintains the axes
    stack (for gca) and supports axes deletion.  Ported changes to GTK, Tk, Wx,
    and FLTK.  Please test!  Added delaxes - JDH

2004-12-21
    Lots of image optimizations - 4x performance boost over 0.65 JDH

0.65 (2004-12-13)
-----------------

2004-12-13
    colors.py: rgb2hex(), hex2color() made simpler (and faster), also rgb2hex()
    - added round() instead of integer truncation hex2color() - changed 256.0
    divisor to 255.0, so now '#ffffff' becomes (1.0,1.0,1.0) not
    (0.996,0.996,0.996) - SC

2004-12-11
    Added ion and ioff to pylab interface - JDH

2004-11-18
    Fixed some report_error bugs in string interpolation as reported on SF bug
    tracker- JDH

2004-11-17

2004-11-09
    backend_cairo.py: Added support for printing to a fileobject.  Disabled
    cairo PS output which is not working correctly. - SC

----------------------------------

0.64 (2004-11-08)
-----------------

2004-11-04
    Changed -dbackend processing to only use known backends, so we don't
    clobber other non-matplotlib uses of -d, like -debug.

2004-11-04
    backend_agg.py: added IMAGE_FORMAT to list the formats that the backend can
    save to.  backend_gtkagg.py: added support for saving JPG files by using
    the GTK backend - SC

2004-10-31
    backend_cairo.py: now produces png and ps files (although the figure sizing
    needs some work). pycairo did not wrap all the necessary functions, so I
    wrapped them myself, they are included in the backend_cairo.py doc string.
    - SC

2004-10-31
    backend_ps.py: clean up the generated PostScript code, use the PostScript
    stack to hold intermediate values instead of storing them in the dictionary.
    - JV

2004-10-30
    backend_ps.py, ft2font.cpp, ft2font.h: fix the position of text in the
    PostScript output.  The new FT2Font method get_descent gives the distance
    between the lower edge of the bounding box and the baseline of a string.
    In backend_ps the text is shifted upwards by this amount. - JV

2004-10-30
    backend_ps.py: clean up the code a lot.  Change the PostScript output to be
    more DSC compliant.  All definitions for the generated PostScript are now

    backend_gtk.py: tidied up print_figure() and removed some of the dependency
    on widget events - SC

2004-10-28
    backend_cairo.py: The renderer is complete except for mathtext,
    draw_image() and clipping. gtkcairo works reasonably well. cairo does not
    yet create any files since I can't figure how to set the 'target surface',
    I don't think pycairo wraps the required functions - SC

2004-10-28
    backend_gtk.py: Improved the save dialog (GTK 2.4 only) so it presents the
    user with a menu of supported image formats - SC

2004-10-28

    Added polar axes and plots - JDH

2004-10-20
    Fixed corrcoef bug exposed by corrcoef(X) where X is matrix - JDH

2004-09-20
    Added toolbar2 message display for backend_tkagg.  JTM

2004-09-17
    Added coords formatter attributes.  These must be callable, and return a
    string for the x or y data. These will be used to format the x and y data
    for the coords box.  Default is the axis major formatter.  e.g.::

        # format the coords message box
        def price(x): return '$%1.2f'%x
        ax.format_xdata = DateFormatter('%Y-%m-%d')
        ax.format_ydata = price

2004-09-17
    Total rewrite of dates handling to use python datetime with num2date,
    date2num and drange.  pytz for timezone handling, dateutils for
    spohisticated ticking.  date ranges from 0001-9999 are supported.  rrules
    allow arbitrary date ticking.  examples/date_demo*.py converted to show new
    usage.  new example examples/date_demo_rrule.py shows how to use rrules in
    date plots.  The date locators are much more general and almost all of them
    have different constructors.  See matplotlib.dates for more info.

2004-09-15
    Applied Fernando's backend __init__ patch to support easier backend
    maintenance.  Added his numutils to mlab.  JDH

2004-09-16
    Re-designated all files in matplotlib/images as binary and w/o keyword
    substitution using "cvs admin -kb \*.svg ...".  See binary files in "info
    cvs" under Linux.  This was messing up builds from CVS on windows since CVS
    was doing lf -> cr/lf and keyword substitution on the bitmaps.  - JTM

2004-09-15
    Modified setup to build array-package-specific extensions for those
    extensions which are array-aware.  Setup builds extensions automatically
    for either Numeric, numarray, or both, depending on what you have
    installed.  Python proxy modules for the array-aware extensions import the
    version optimized for numarray or Numeric determined by numerix.  - JTM

2004-09-15
    Moved definitions of infinity from mlab to numerix to avoid divide by zero
    warnings for numarray - JTM

--------------------------------------------

This is the Old, stale, never used changelog

2002-12-10
    - Added a TODO file and CHANGELOG.  Lots to do -- get crackin'!

    - Fixed y zoom tool bug

    - Adopted a compromise fix for the y data clipping problem.  The problem
      was that for solid lines, the y data clipping (as opposed to the gc
      clipping) caused artifactual horizontal solid lines near the ylim
      boundaries.  I did a 5% offset hack in Axes set_ylim functions which
      helped, but didn't cure the problem for very high gain y zooms.  So I
      disabled y data clipping for connected lines .  If you need extensive y
      clipping, either plot(y,x) because x data clipping is always enabled, or
      change the _set_clip code to 'if 1' as indicated in the lines.py src.
      See _set_clip in lines.py and set_ylim in figure.py for more information.

2002-12-11
    - Added a measurement dialog to the figure window to measure axes position
      and the delta x delta y with a left mouse drag.  These defaults can be
      overridden by deriving from Figure and overriding button_press_event,
      button_release_event, and motion_notify_event, and _dialog_measure_tool.

    - fixed the navigation dialog so you can check the axes the navigation
      buttons apply to.

2003-04-23
    Released matplotlib v0.1

2003-04-24
    Added a new line style PixelLine2D which is the plots the markers as pixels
    (as small as possible) with format symbol ','

    Added a new class Patch with derived classes Rectangle, RegularPolygon and
    Circle

2003-04-25
    Implemented new functions errorbar, scatter and hist

    Added a new line type '|' which is a vline.  syntax is plot(x, Y, '|')
    where y.shape = len(x),2 and each row gives the ymin,ymax for the
    respective values of x.  Previously I had implemented vlines as a list of
    lines, but I needed the efficiency of the numeric clipping for large
    numbers of vlines outside the viewport, so I wrote a dedicated class
    Vline2D which derives from Line2D

2003-05-01
    Fixed ytick bug where grid and tick show outside axis viewport with gc clip

2003-05-14
    Added new ways to specify colors 1) matlab format string 2) html-style hex
    string, 3) rgb tuple.  See examples/color_demo.py

2003-05-28
    Changed figure rendering to draw form a pixmap to reduce flicker.  See
    examples/system_monitor.py for an example where the plot is continuously
    updated w/o flicker.  This example is meant to simulate a system monitor
    that shows free CPU, RAM, etc...

2003-08-04
    Added Jon Anderson's GTK shell, which doesn't require pygtk to have
    threading built-in and looks nice!

2003-08-25
    Fixed deprecation warnings for python2.3 and pygtk-1.99.18

2003-08-26
    Added figure text with new example examples/figtext.py

2003-08-27
    Fixed bugs in figure text with font override dictionaries and fig text that
    was placed outside the window bounding box

2003-09-01 through 2003-09-15
    Added a postscript and a GD module backend

2003-09-16
    Fixed font scaling and point scaling so circles, squares, etc on lines will
    scale with DPI as will fonts.  Font scaling is not fully implemented on the
    gtk backend because I have not figured out how to scale fonts to arbitrary
    sizes with GTK

2003-09-17
    Fixed figure text bug which crashed X windows on long figure text extending
    beyond display area.  This was, I believe, due to the vestigial erase
    functionality that was no longer needed since I began rendering to a pixmap

2003-09-30
    Added legend

2003-10-01
    Fixed bug when colors are specified with rgb tuple or hex string.

2003-10-21
    Andrew Straw provided some legend code which I modified and incorporated.
    Thanks Andrew!

2003-10-27
    Fixed a bug in axis.get_view_distance that affected zoom in versus out with
    interactive scrolling, and a bug in the axis text reset system that
    prevented the text from being redrawn on a interactive gtk view lim set
    with the widget

    Fixed a bug in that prevented the manual setting of ticklabel strings from
    working properly

2003-11-02
    - Do a nearest neighbor color pick on GD when allocate fails

2003-11-02
    - Added pcolor plot
    - Added MRI example
    - Fixed bug that screwed up label position if xticks or yticks were empty
    - added nearest neighbor color picker when GD max colors exceeded
    - fixed figure background color bug in GD backend

2003-11-10 - 2003-11-11
    major refactoring.

    * Ticks (with labels, lines and grid) handled by dedicated class
    * Artist now know bounding box and dpi
    * Bounding boxes and transforms handled by dedicated classes
    * legend in dedicated class.  Does a better job of alignment and bordering.
      Can be initialized with specific line instances.  See
      examples/legend_demo2.py

2003-11-14
    Fixed legend positioning bug and added new position args

2003-11-16

2003-11-20
    - port Gary's errorbar code to new API before 0.40

2003-11-20
    - problem with stale _set_font.  legend axes box doesn't resize on save in
      GTK backend -- see htdocs legend_demo.py
