Blending and compositing artists
--------------------------------

There are now alternative options for blending and compositing artists on top
of previously drawn artists, instead of the normal alpha blending.  The
behavior is controlled by the artist's ``blend_mode`` property.  See
:ref:`blend-modes` for a gallery and for a table of supporting backends.
