Deprecated ``register`` on ``matplotlib.patches._Styles`` and subclasses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class method is never used internally.  Due to the internal check in the
method it only accepts subclasses of a private baseclass embedded in the host
class which makes it unlikely that it has been used externally.
