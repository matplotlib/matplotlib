`matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase` is no longer a subclass of `.ScalarMappable`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This inheritance lead to a confusing situation where the
`ScalarMappable` passed to `matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar` (`~.Figure.colorbar`)
had a ``set_norm`` method, as did the colorbar.  The colorbar is now purely a
slave to the `ScalarMappable` norm and colormap, and the old inherited methods
`~matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase.set_norm`,
`~matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase.set_cmap`,
`~matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase.set_clim` are deprecated, as are the
getter versions of those calls.  To set the norm associated with a colorbar do
``colorbar.mappable.set_norm()`` etc.
