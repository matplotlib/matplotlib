New `Formatter.format_ticks` method
```````````````````````````````````

The `Formatter` class gained a new `~Formatter.format_ticks` methods, which
takes the list of all tick locations as single argument and returns the list
of all formatted values.  It is called by the axis tick handling code and, by
default, repeatedly calls `~Formatter.__call__`.

It is intended to be overridden by `Formatter` subclasses for which
the formatting of a tick value depends on other tick values, such as
`ConciseDateFormatter`.
