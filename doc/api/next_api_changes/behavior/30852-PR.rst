Default focus behavior of ``FigureCanvasTkAgg``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, when a `.FigureCanvasTkAgg` object was created, focus was set to the
canvas by default. Now, focus is not set anymore. If focus is desired on the canvas,
it can be set explicitly after creation using the ``focus_set()`` method of Tkinter
widgets.

See :doc:`../../../gallery/user_interfaces/embedding_in_tk_sgskip` for an example of
focus-setting in an embedded Matplotlib figure in a Tkinter application.
