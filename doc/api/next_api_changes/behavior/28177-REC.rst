(Sub)Figure.get_figure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...in future will by default return the direct parent figure, which may be a SubFigure.
This will make the default behavior consistent with the
`~matplotlib.artist.Artist.get_figure` method of other artists.  To control the
behavior, use the newly introduced *root* parameter.
