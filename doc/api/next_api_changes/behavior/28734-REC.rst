``suptitle`` in compressed layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compressed layout now automatically positions the `~.Figure.suptitle` just
above the top row of axes.  To keep this title in its previous position,
either pass ``in_layout=False`` or explicitly set ``y=0.98`` in the
`~.Figure.suptitle` call.
