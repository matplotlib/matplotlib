grouped_bar hatch broadcasting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, `.Axes.grouped_bar` applied the same hatch pattern to all bars,
even when plotting multiple datasets.  It now supports hatch broadcasting,
allowing one hatch pattern per dataset, similar to color broadcasting.

This change improves visual differentiation and consistency with other
multi-dataset plotting functions such as `.Axes.hist`.
