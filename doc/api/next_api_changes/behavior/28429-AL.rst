Tick locating code now ensure that the locator's axis is correctly set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tick locators maintain a reference to the Axis on which they are used (so that
they can e.g. check the size of the Axis to know how many ticks will fit), but
is problematic if the same locator object is used for multiple Axis.  From now
on, before calling a locator to determine tick locations, Matplotlib will
ensure that the locator's axis is correctly (temporarily) set to the correct
Axis.  This fix can cause a change in behavior if a locator's axis had been
intentionally set to an artificial value.
