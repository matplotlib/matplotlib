imshow *interpolation_stage* default changed to 'antialiased'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *interpolation_stage* keyword argument `~.Axes.imshow` has a new default
value 'antialiased'.  For images that are up-sampled less than a factor of
three or down-sampled , image interpolation will occur in 'rgba' space.  For images
that are up-sampled by more than a factor of 3, then image interpolation occurs
in 'data' space.

The previous default was 'data', so down-sampled images may change subtly with
the new default.  However, the new default also avoids floating point artifacts
at sharp boundaries in a colormap when down-sampling.

The previous behavior can achieved by changing :rc:`image.interpolation_stage`.
