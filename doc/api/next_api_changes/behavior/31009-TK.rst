imshow pixel alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``imshow`` now rounds the output image dimensions to the nearest integer pixel
rather than always using ``math.ceil``. This ensures that the edges of raster
pixels align correctly with vector grid lines and patches, preventing 1-pixel
overlaps or gaps when the image is small or pixels are large.
