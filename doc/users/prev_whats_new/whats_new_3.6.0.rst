Figure and Axes creation / management
=====================================
``subplots``, ``subplot_mosaic`` accept *height_ratios* and *width_ratios* arguments
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The relative width and height of columns and rows in `~.Figure.subplots` and
`~.Figure.subplot_mosaic` can be controlled by passing *height_ratios* and
*width_ratios* keyword arguments to the methods:

.. plot::
    :alt: A figure with three subplots in three rows and one column. The height of the subplot in the first row is three times than the subplots in the 2nd and 3rd row.
    :include-source: true

    fig = plt.figure()
    axs = fig.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True, height_ratios=[3, 1, 1])

Previously, this required passing the ratios in *gridspec_kw* arguments::

    fig = plt.figure()
    axs = fig.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True,
                       gridspec_kw=dict(height_ratios=[3, 1, 1]))

Constrained layout is no longer considered experimental
-------------------------------------------------------

The constrained layout engine and API is no longer considered experimental.
Arbitrary changes to behaviour and API are no longer permitted without a
deprecation period.

New ``layout_engine`` module
----------------------------

Matplotlib ships with ``tight_layout`` and ``constrained_layout`` layout
engines.  A new `.layout_engine` module is provided to allow downstream
libraries to write their own layout engines and `~.figure.Figure` objects can
now take a `.LayoutEngine` subclass as an argument to the *layout* parameter.

Compressed layout for fixed-aspect ratio Axes
---------------------------------------------

Simple arrangements of Axes with fixed aspect ratios can now be packed together
with ``fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 3, layout='compressed')``.

With ``layout='tight'`` or ``'constrained'``, Axes with a fixed aspect ratio
can leave large gaps between each other:

.. plot::
    :alt: A figure labelled "fixed-aspect plots, layout=constrained". Figure has subplots displayed in 2 rows and 2 columns; Subplots have large gaps between each other.

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(5, 3),
                            sharex=True, sharey=True, layout="constrained")
    for ax in axs.flat:
        ax.imshow([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
    fig.suptitle("fixed-aspect plots, layout='constrained'")

Using the ``layout='compressed'`` layout reduces the space between the Axes,
and adds the extra space to the outer margins:

.. plot::
    :alt: Four identical two by two heatmaps, each cell a different color: purple, blue, yellow, green going clockwise from upper left corner. The four heatmaps are laid out in a two by two grid with minimum white space between the heatmaps.

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(5, 3),
                            sharex=True, sharey=True, layout='compressed')
    for ax in axs.flat:
        ax.imshow([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
    fig.suptitle("fixed-aspect plots, layout='compressed'")

See :ref:`compressed_layout` for further details.

Layout engines may now be removed
---------------------------------

The layout engine on a Figure may now be removed by calling
`.Figure.set_layout_engine` with ``'none'``. This may be useful after computing
layout in order to reduce computations, e.g., for subsequent animation loops.

A different layout engine may be set afterwards, so long as it is compatible
with the previous layout engine.

``Axes.inset_axes`` flexibility
-------------------------------

`matplotlib.axes.Axes.inset_axes` now accepts the *projection*, *polar* and
*axes_class* keyword arguments, so that subclasses of `matplotlib.axes.Axes`
may be returned.

.. plot::
    :alt: Plot of a straight line y=x, with a small inset axes in the lower right corner that shows a circle with radial grid lines and a line plotted in polar coordinates.
    :include-source: true

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

    ax.plot([0, 2], [1, 2])

    polar_ax = ax.inset_axes([0.75, 0.25, 0.2, 0.2], projection='polar')
    polar_ax.plot([0, 2], [1, 2])

WebP is now a supported output format
-------------------------------------

Figures may now be saved in WebP format by using the ``.webp`` file extension,
or passing ``format='webp'`` to `~.Figure.savefig`. This relies on `Pillow
<https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ support for WebP.

Garbage collection is no longer run on figure close
---------------------------------------------------

Matplotlib has a large number of circular references (between Figure and
Manager, between Axes and Figure, Axes and Artist, Figure and Canvas, etc.) so
when the user drops their last reference to a Figure (and clears it from
pyplot's state), the objects will not immediately be deleted.

To account for this we have long (since before 2004) had a `gc.collect` (of the
lowest two generations only) in the closing code in order to promptly clean up
after ourselves. However this is both not doing what we want (as most of our
objects will actually survive) and due to clearing out the first generation
opened us up to having unbounded memory usage.

In cases with a very tight loop between creating the figure and destroying it
(e.g. ``plt.figure(); plt.close()``) the first generation will never grow large
enough for Python to consider running the collection on the higher generations.
This will lead to unbounded memory usage as the long-lived objects are never
re-considered to look for reference cycles and hence are never deleted.

We now no longer do any garbage collection when a figure is closed, and rely on
Python automatically deciding to run garbage collection periodically. If you
have strict memory requirements, you can call `gc.collect` yourself but this
may have performance impacts in a tight computation loop.

Plotting methods
================

Striped lines (experimental)
----------------------------

The new *gapcolor* parameter to `~.Axes.plot` enables the creation of striped
lines.

.. plot::
    :alt: Plot of x**3 where the line is an orange-blue striped line, achieved using the keywords linestyle='--', color='orange', gapcolor='blue'
    :include-source: true

    x = np.linspace(1., 3., 10)
    y = x**3

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x, y, linestyle='--', color='orange', gapcolor='blue',
            linewidth=3, label='a striped line')
    ax.legend()

Custom cap widths in box and whisker plots in ``bxp`` and ``boxplot``
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The new *capwidths* parameter to `~.Axes.bxp` and `~.Axes.boxplot` allows
controlling the widths of the caps in box and whisker plots.

.. plot::
    :alt: A box plot with capwidths 0.01 and 0.2 
    :include-source: true

    x = np.linspace(-7, 7, 140)
    x = np.hstack([-25, x, 25])
    capwidths = [0.01, 0.2]

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.boxplot([x, x], notch=True, capwidths=capwidths)
    ax.set_title(f'{capwidths=}')

Easier labelling of bars in bar plot
------------------------------------

The *label* argument of `~.Axes.bar` and `~.Axes.barh` can now be passed a list
of labels for the bars. The list must be the same length as *x* and labels the
individual bars. Repeated labels are not de-duplicated and will cause repeated
label entries, so this is best used when bars also differ in style (e.g., by
passing a list to *color*, as below.)

.. plot::
    :alt: Bar chart: blue bar height 10, orange bar height 20, green bar height 15 legend with blue box labeled a, orange box labeled b, and green box labeled c
    :include-source: true

    x = ["a", "b", "c"]
    y = [10, 20, 15]
    color = ['C0', 'C1', 'C2']

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.bar(x, y, color=color, label=x)
    ax.legend()

New style format string for colorbar ticks
------------------------------------------

The *format* argument of `~.Figure.colorbar` (and other colorbar methods) now
accepts ``{}``-style format strings.

.. code-block:: python

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    im = ax.imshow(z)
    fig.colorbar(im, format='{x:.2e}')  # Instead of '%.2e'

Linestyles for negative contours may be set individually
--------------------------------------------------------

The line style of negative contours may be set by passing the
*negative_linestyles* argument to `.Axes.contour`. Previously, this style could
only be set globally via :rc:`contour.negative_linestyle`.

.. plot::
    :alt: Two contour plots, each showing two positive and two negative contours. The positive contours are shown in solid black lines in both plots. In one plot the negative contours are shown in dashed lines, which is the current styling. In the other plot they're shown in dotted lines, which is one of the new options.
    :include-source: true

    delta = 0.025
    x = np.arange(-3.0, 3.0, delta)
    y = np.arange(-2.0, 2.0, delta)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z1 = np.exp(-X**2 - Y**2)
    Z2 = np.exp(-(X - 1)**2 - (Y - 1)**2)
    Z = (Z1 - Z2) * 2

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2)

    CS = axs[0].contour(X, Y, Z, 6, colors='k')
    axs[0].clabel(CS, fontsize=9, inline=True)
    axs[0].set_title('Default negative contours')

    CS = axs[1].contour(X, Y, Z, 6, colors='k', negative_linestyles='dotted')
    axs[1].clabel(CS, fontsize=9, inline=True)
    axs[1].set_title('Dotted negative contours')

Improved quad contour calculations via ContourPy
------------------------------------------------

The contouring functions `~.axes.Axes.contour` and `~.axes.Axes.contourf` have
a new keyword argument *algorithm* to control which algorithm is used to
calculate the contours. There is a choice of four algorithms to use, and the
default is to use ``algorithm='mpl2014'`` which is the same algorithm that
Matplotlib has been using since 2014.

Previously Matplotlib shipped its own C++ code for calculating the contours of
quad grids. Now the external library `ContourPy
<https://github.com/contourpy/contourpy>`_ is used instead.

Other possible values of the *algorithm* keyword argument at this time are
``'mpl2005'``, ``'serial'`` and ``'threaded'``; see the `ContourPy
documentation <https://contourpy.readthedocs.io>`_ for further details.

.. note::

   Contour lines and polygons produced by ``algorithm='mpl2014'`` will be the
   same as those produced before this change to within floating-point
   tolerance. The exception is for duplicate points, i.e. contours containing
   adjacent (x, y) points that are identical; previously the duplicate points
   were removed, now they are kept. Contours affected by this will produce the
   same visual output, but there will be a greater number of points in the
   contours.

   The locations of contour labels obtained by using `~.axes.Axes.clabel` may
   also be different.

``errorbar`` supports *markerfacecoloralt*
------------------------------------------

The *markerfacecoloralt* parameter is now passed to the line plotter from
`.Axes.errorbar`. The documentation now accurately lists which properties are
passed to `.Line2D`, rather than claiming that all keyword arguments are passed
on.

.. plot::
    :alt: Graph with error bar showing ±0.2 error on the x-axis, and ±0.4 error on the y-axis. Error bar marker is a circle radius 20. Error bar face color is blue.
    :include-source: true

    x = np.arange(0.1, 4, 0.5)
    y = np.exp(-x)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.errorbar(x, y, xerr=0.2, yerr=0.4,
                linestyle=':', color='darkgrey',
                marker='o', markersize=20, fillstyle='left',
                markerfacecolor='tab:blue', markerfacecoloralt='tab:orange',
                markeredgecolor='tab:brown', markeredgewidth=2)

``streamplot`` can disable streamline breaks
--------------------------------------------

It is now possible to specify that streamplots have continuous, unbroken
streamlines. Previously streamlines would end to limit the number of lines
within a single grid cell. See the difference between the plots below:

.. plot::
    :alt: A figure with two streamplots. First streamplot has broken streamlines. Second streamplot has continuous streamlines.
    
    w = 3
    Y, X = np.mgrid[-w:w:100j, -w:w:100j]
    U = -1 - X**2 + Y
    V = 1 + X - Y**2
    speed = np.sqrt(U**2 + V**2)

    fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharex=True)

    ax0.streamplot(X, Y, U, V, broken_streamlines=True)
    ax0.set_title('broken_streamlines=True')

    ax1.streamplot(X, Y, U, V, broken_streamlines=False)
    ax1.set_title('broken_streamlines=False')

New axis scale ``asinh`` (experimental)
---------------------------------------

The new ``asinh`` axis scale offers an alternative to ``symlog`` that smoothly
transitions between the quasi-linear and asymptotically logarithmic regions of
the scale. This is based on an arcsinh transformation that allows plotting both
positive and negative values that span many orders of magnitude.

.. plot::
    :alt: Figure with 2 subplots. Subplot on the left uses symlog scale on the y axis. The transition at -2 is not smooth. Subplot on the right use asinh scale. The transition at -2 is smooth. 

    fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharex=True)
    x = np.linspace(-3, 6, 100)

    ax0.plot(x, x)
    ax0.set_yscale('symlog')
    ax0.grid()
    ax0.set_title('symlog')

    ax1.plot(x, x)
    ax1.set_yscale('asinh')
    ax1.grid()
    ax1.set_title(r'$sinh^{-1}$')

    for p in (-2, 2):
        for ax in (ax0, ax1):
            c = plt.Circle((p, p), radius=0.5, fill=False,
                           color='red', alpha=0.8, lw=3)
            ax.add_patch(c)

``stairs(..., fill=True)`` hides patch edge by setting linewidth
----------------------------------------------------------------

``stairs(..., fill=True)`` would previously hide Patch edges by setting
``edgecolor="none"``. Consequently, calling ``set_color()`` on the Patch later
would make the Patch appear larger.

Now, by using ``linewidth=0``, this apparent size change is prevented. Likewise
calling ``stairs(..., fill=True, linewidth=3)`` will behave more transparently.

Fix the dash offset of the Patch class
--------------------------------------

Formerly, when setting the line style on a `.Patch` object using a dash tuple,
the offset was ignored. Now the offset is applied to the Patch as expected and
it can be used as it is used with `.Line2D` objects.

Rectangle patch rotation point
------------------------------

The rotation point of the `~matplotlib.patches.Rectangle` can now be set to
'xy', 'center' or a 2-tuple of numbers using the *rotation_point* argument.

.. plot::
    :alt: Blue square that isn't rotated. Green square rotated 45 degrees relative to center. Orange square rotated 45 degrees relative to lower right corner. Red square rotated 45 degrees relative to point in upper right quadrant.  

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

    rect = plt.Rectangle((0, 0), 1, 1, facecolor='none', edgecolor='C0')
    ax.add_patch(rect)
    ax.annotate('Unrotated', (1, 0), color='C0',
                horizontalalignment='right', verticalalignment='top',
                xytext=(0, -3), textcoords='offset points')

    for rotation_point, color in zip(['xy', 'center', (0.75, 0.25)],
                                     ['C1', 'C2', 'C3']):
        ax.add_patch(
            plt.Rectangle((0, 0), 1, 1, facecolor='none', edgecolor=color,
                          angle=45, rotation_point=rotation_point))

        if rotation_point == 'center':
            point = 0.5, 0.5
        elif rotation_point == 'xy':
            point = 0, 0
        else:
            point = rotation_point
        ax.plot(point[:1], point[1:], color=color, marker='o')

        label = f'{rotation_point}'
        if label == 'xy':
            label += ' (default)'
        ax.annotate(label, point, color=color,
                    xytext=(3, 3), textcoords='offset points')

    ax.set_aspect(1)
    ax.set_title('rotation_point options')

Colors and colormaps
====================

Color sequence registry
-----------------------

The color sequence registry, `.ColorSequenceRegistry`, contains sequences
(i.e., simple lists) of colors that are known to Matplotlib by name. This will
not normally be used directly, but through the universal instance at
`matplotlib.color_sequences`.

Colormap method for creating a different lookup table size
----------------------------------------------------------

The new method `.Colormap.resampled` creates a new `.Colormap` instance
with the specified lookup table size. This is a replacement for manipulating
the lookup table size via ``get_cmap``.

Use::

    get_cmap(name).resampled(N)

instead of::

    get_cmap(name, lut=N)

Setting norms with strings
--------------------------

Norms can now be set (e.g. on images) using the string name of the
corresponding scale, e.g. ``imshow(array, norm="log")``.  Note that in that
case, it is permissible to also pass *vmin* and *vmax*, as a new Norm instance
will be created under the hood.

Titles, ticks, and labels
=========================

``plt.xticks`` and ``plt.yticks`` support *minor* keyword argument
------------------------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to set or get minor ticks using `.pyplot.xticks` and
`.pyplot.yticks` by setting ``minor=True``.

.. plot::
    :alt: Plot showing a line from 1,2 to 3.5,-0.5. X axis showing the 1, 2 and 3 minor ticks on the x axis as One, Zwei, Trois. 
    :include-source: true

    plt.figure()
    plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 3.5], [2, 1, 0, -0.5])
    plt.xticks([1, 2, 3], ["One", "Zwei", "Trois"])
    plt.xticks([np.sqrt(2), 2.5, np.pi],
               [r"$\sqrt{2}$", r"$\frac{5}{2}$", r"$\pi$"], minor=True)

Legends
=======

Legend can control alignment of title and handles
-------------------------------------------------

`.Legend` now supports controlling the alignment of the title and handles via
the keyword argument *alignment*. You can also use `.Legend.set_alignment` to
control the alignment on existing Legends.

.. plot::
    :alt: Figure with 3 subplots. All the subplots are titled test. The three subplots have legends titled alignment='left', alignment='center', alignment='right'. The legend texts are respectively aligned left, center and right.
    :include-source: true

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1)
    for i, alignment in enumerate(['left', 'center', 'right']):
        axs[i].plot(range(10), label='test')
        axs[i].legend(title=f'{alignment=}', alignment=alignment)

*ncol* keyword argument to ``legend`` renamed to *ncols*
--------------------------------------------------------

The *ncol* keyword argument to `~.Axes.legend` for controlling the number of
columns is renamed to *ncols* for consistency with the *ncols* and *nrows*
keywords of `~.Figure.subplots` and `~.GridSpec`. *ncol* remains supported for
backwards compatibility, but is discouraged.

Markers
=======

``marker`` can now be set to the string "none"
----------------------------------------------

The string "none" means *no-marker*, consistent with other APIs which support
the lowercase version.  Using "none" is recommended over using "None", to avoid
confusion with the None object.

Customization of ``MarkerStyle`` join and cap style
---------------------------------------------------

New `.MarkerStyle` parameters allow control of join style and cap style, and
for the user to supply a transformation to be applied to the marker (e.g. a
rotation).

.. plot::
    :alt: Three rows of markers, columns are blue, green, and purple. First row is y-shaped markers with different capstyles: butt, end is squared off at endpoint; projecting, end is squared off at short distance from endpoint; round, end is rounded. Second row is star-shaped markers with different join styles: miter, star points are sharp triangles; round, star points are rounded; bevel, star points are beveled. Last row shows stars rotated at different angles: small star rotated 0 degrees - top point vertical; medium star rotated 45 degrees - top point tilted right; large star rotated 90 degrees - top point tilted left.
    :include-source: true

    from matplotlib.markers import CapStyle, JoinStyle, MarkerStyle
    from matplotlib.transforms import Affine2D

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1, layout='constrained')
    for ax in axs:
        ax.axis('off')
        ax.set_xlim(-0.5, 2.5)

    axs[0].set_title('Cap styles', fontsize=14)
    for col, cap in enumerate(CapStyle):
        axs[0].plot(col, 0, markersize=32, markeredgewidth=8,
                    marker=MarkerStyle('1', capstyle=cap))
        # Show the marker edge for comparison with the cap.
        axs[0].plot(col, 0, markersize=32, markeredgewidth=1,
                    markerfacecolor='none', markeredgecolor='lightgrey',
                    marker=MarkerStyle('1'))
        axs[0].annotate(cap.name, (col, 0),
                        xytext=(20, -5), textcoords='offset points')

    axs[1].set_title('Join styles', fontsize=14)
    for col, join in enumerate(JoinStyle):
        axs[1].plot(col, 0, markersize=32, markeredgewidth=8,
                    marker=MarkerStyle('*', joinstyle=join))
        # Show the marker edge for comparison with the join.
        axs[1].plot(col, 0, markersize=32, markeredgewidth=1,
                    markerfacecolor='none', markeredgecolor='lightgrey',
                    marker=MarkerStyle('*'))
        axs[1].annotate(join.name, (col, 0),
                        xytext=(20, -5), textcoords='offset points')

    axs[2].set_title('Arbitrary transforms', fontsize=14)
    for col, (size, rot) in enumerate(zip([2, 5, 7], [0, 45, 90])):
        t = Affine2D().rotate_deg(rot).scale(size)
        axs[2].plot(col, 0, marker=MarkerStyle('*', transform=t))

Fonts and Text
==============

Font fallback
-------------

It is now possible to specify a list of fonts families and Matplotlib will try
them in order to locate a required glyph.

.. plot::
   :caption: Demonstration of mixed English and Chinese text with font fallback.
   :alt: The phrase "There are 几个汉字 in between!" rendered in various fonts.
   :include-source: True

   plt.rcParams["font.size"] = 20
   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4.75, 1.85))

   text = "There are 几个汉字 in between!"
   fig.text(0.05, 0.65, text, family=["Noto Sans CJK JP", "Noto Sans TC"])
   fig.text(0.05, 0.45, text, family=["DejaVu Sans", "Noto Sans CJK JP", "Noto Sans TC"])

This currently works with the Agg (and all of the GUI embeddings), svg, pdf,
ps, and inline backends.

List of available font names
----------------------------

The list of available fonts are now easily accessible. To get a list of the
available font names in Matplotlib use:

.. code-block:: python

    from matplotlib import font_manager
    font_manager.get_font_names()

``math_to_image`` now has a *color* keyword argument
----------------------------------------------------

To easily support external libraries that rely on the MathText rendering of
Matplotlib to generate equation images, a *color* keyword argument was added to
`~matplotlib.mathtext.math_to_image`.

.. code-block:: python

    from matplotlib import mathtext
    mathtext.math_to_image('$x^2$', 'filename.png', color='Maroon')

Active URL area rotates with link text
--------------------------------------

When link text is rotated in a figure, the active URL area will now include the
rotated link area. Previously, the active area remained in the original,
non-rotated, position.

rcParams improvements
=====================

Allow setting figure label size and weight globally and separately from title
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For figure labels, ``Figure.supxlabel`` and ``Figure.supylabel``, the size and
weight can be set separately from the figure title using :rc:`figure.labelsize`
and :rc:`figure.labelweight`.

.. plot::
    :alt: A figure with 4 plots organised in 2 rows and 2 columns. The title of the figure is suptitle in bold and 64 points. The x axis is labelled supxlabel, and y axis is labelled subylabel. Both labels are 32 points and bold.
    :include-source: true

    # Original (previously combined with below) rcParams:
    plt.rcParams['figure.titlesize'] = 64
    plt.rcParams['figure.titleweight'] = 'bold'

    # New rcParams:
    plt.rcParams['figure.labelsize'] = 32
    plt.rcParams['figure.labelweight'] = 'bold'

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, layout='constrained')
    for ax in axs.flat:
        ax.set(xlabel='xlabel', ylabel='ylabel')

    fig.suptitle('suptitle')
    fig.supxlabel('supxlabel')
    fig.supylabel('supylabel')

Note that if you have changed :rc:`figure.titlesize` or
:rc:`figure.titleweight`, you must now also change the introduced parameters
for a result consistent with past behaviour.

Mathtext parsing can be disabled globally
-----------------------------------------

The :rc:`text.parse_math` setting may be used to disable parsing of mathtext in
all `.Text` objects (most notably from the `.Axes.text` method).

Double-quoted strings in matplotlibrc
-------------------------------------

You can now use double-quotes around strings. This allows using the '#'
character in strings. Without quotes, '#' is interpreted as start of a comment.
In particular, you can now define hex-colors:

.. code-block:: none

   grid.color: "#b0b0b0"

3D Axes improvements
====================

Standardized views for primary plane viewing angles
---------------------------------------------------

When viewing a 3D plot in one of the primary view planes (i.e., perpendicular
to the XY, XZ, or YZ planes), the Axis will be displayed in a standard
location. For further information on 3D views, see
:ref:`toolkit_mplot3d-view-angles` and :doc:`/gallery/mplot3d/view_planes_3d`.

Custom focal length for 3D camera
---------------------------------

The 3D Axes can now better mimic real-world cameras by specifying the focal
length of the virtual camera. The default focal length of 1 corresponds to a
Field of View (FOV) of 90°, and is backwards-compatible with existing 3D plots.
An increased focal length between 1 and infinity "flattens" the image, while a
decreased focal length between 1 and 0 exaggerates the perspective and gives
the image more apparent depth.

The focal length can be calculated from a desired FOV via the equation:

.. mathmpl::

    focal\_length = 1/\tan(FOV/2)

.. plot::
    :alt: A figure showing 3 basic 3D Wireframe plots. From left to right, the plots use focal length of 0.2, 1 and infinity. Focal length between 0.2 and 1 produce plot with depth while focal length between 1 and infinity show relatively flattened image.
    :include-source: true

    from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import axes3d

    X, Y, Z = axes3d.get_test_data(0.05)

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(7, 4),
                            subplot_kw={'projection': '3d'})

    for ax, focal_length in zip(axs, [0.2, 1, np.inf]):
        ax.plot_wireframe(X, Y, Z, rstride=10, cstride=10)
        ax.set_proj_type('persp', focal_length=focal_length)
        ax.set_title(f"{focal_length=}")

3D plots gained a 3rd "roll" viewing angle
------------------------------------------

3D plots can now be viewed from any orientation with the addition of a 3rd roll
angle, which rotates the plot about the viewing axis. Interactive rotation
using the mouse still only controls elevation and azimuth, meaning that this
feature is relevant to users who create more complex camera angles
programmatically. The default roll angle of 0 is backwards-compatible with
existing 3D plots.

.. plot::
    :alt: View of a wireframe of a 3D contour that is somewhat a thickened s shape. Elevation and azimuth are 0 degrees so the shape is viewed straight on, but tilted because the roll is 30 degrees.
    :include-source: true

    from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import axes3d

    X, Y, Z = axes3d.get_test_data(0.05)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': '3d'})

    ax.plot_wireframe(X, Y, Z, rstride=10, cstride=10)
    ax.view_init(elev=0, azim=0, roll=30)
    ax.set_title('elev=0, azim=0, roll=30')

Equal aspect ratio for 3D plots
-------------------------------

Users can set the aspect ratio for the X, Y, Z axes of a 3D plot to be 'equal',
'equalxy', 'equalxz', or 'equalyz' rather than the default of 'auto'.

.. plot::
    :alt: Five plots, each showing a different aspect option for a rectangle that has height 4, depth 1, and width 1. auto: none of the dimensions have equal aspect, depth and width form a rectangular and height appears shrunken in proportion. equal: all the dimensions have equal aspect. equalxy: width and depth equal, height not so looks shrunken in proportion. equalyz: depth and height equal, width not so elongated. equalxz: width and height equal, depth not so elongated.
    :include-source: true

    from itertools import combinations, product

    aspects = [
        ['auto', 'equal', '.'],
        ['equalxy', 'equalyz', 'equalxz'],
    ]
    fig, axs = plt.subplot_mosaic(aspects, figsize=(7, 6),
                                  subplot_kw={'projection': '3d'})

    # Draw rectangular cuboid with side lengths [1, 1, 5]
    r = [0, 1]
    scale = np.array([1, 1, 5])
    pts = combinations(np.array(list(product(r, r, r))), 2)
    for start, end in pts:
        if np.sum(np.abs(start - end)) == r[1] - r[0]:
            for ax in axs.values():
                ax.plot3D(*zip(start*scale, end*scale), color='C0')

    # Set the aspect ratios
    for aspect, ax in axs.items():
        ax.set_box_aspect((3, 4, 5))
        ax.set_aspect(aspect)
        ax.set_title(f'set_aspect({aspect!r})')

Interactive tool improvements
=============================

Rotation, aspect ratio correction and add/remove state
------------------------------------------------------

The `.RectangleSelector` and `.EllipseSelector` can now be rotated
interactively between -45° and 45°. The range limits are currently dictated by
the implementation. The rotation is enabled or disabled by striking the *r* key
('r' is the default key mapped to 'rotate' in *state_modifier_keys*) or by
calling ``selector.add_state('rotate')``.

The aspect ratio of the axes can now be taken into account when using the
"square" state. This is enabled by specifying ``use_data_coordinates='True'``
when the selector is initialized.

In addition to changing selector state interactively using the modifier keys
defined in *state_modifier_keys*, the selector state can now be changed
programmatically using the *add_state* and *remove_state* methods.

.. code-block:: python

    from matplotlib.widgets import RectangleSelector

    values = np.arange(0, 100)

    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot()
    ax.plot(values, values)

    selector = RectangleSelector(ax, print, interactive=True,
                                 drag_from_anywhere=True,
                                 use_data_coordinates=True)
    selector.add_state('rotate')  # alternatively press 'r' key
    # rotate the selector interactively

    selector.remove_state('rotate')  # alternatively press 'r' key

    selector.add_state('square')

``MultiCursor`` now supports Axes split over multiple figures
-------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, `.MultiCursor` only worked if all target Axes belonged to the same
figure.

As a consequence of this change, the first argument to the `.MultiCursor`
constructor has become unused (it was previously the joint canvas of all Axes,
but the canvases are now directly inferred from the list of Axes).

``PolygonSelector`` bounding boxes
----------------------------------

`.PolygonSelector` now has a *draw_bounding_box* argument, which when set to
`True` will draw a bounding box around the polygon once it is complete. The
bounding box can be resized and moved, allowing the points of the polygon to be
easily resized.

Setting ``PolygonSelector`` vertices
------------------------------------

The vertices of `.PolygonSelector` can now be set programmatically by using the
`.PolygonSelector.verts` property. Setting the vertices this way will reset the
selector, and create a new complete selector with the supplied vertices.

``SpanSelector`` widget can now be snapped to specified values
--------------------------------------------------------------

The `.SpanSelector` widget can now be snapped to values specified by the
*snap_values* argument.

More toolbar icons are styled for dark themes
---------------------------------------------

On the macOS and Tk backends, toolbar icons will now be inverted when using a
dark theme.

Platform-specific changes
=========================

Wx backend uses standard toolbar
--------------------------------

Instead of a custom sizer, the toolbar is set on Wx windows as a standard
toolbar.

Improvements to macosx backend
------------------------------

Modifier keys handled more consistently
.......................................

The macosx backend now handles modifier keys in a manner more consistent with
other backends. See the table in :ref:`event-connections` for further
information.

``savefig.directory`` rcParam support
.....................................

The macosx backend will now obey the :rc:`savefig.directory` setting. If set to
a non-empty string, then the save dialog will default to this directory, and
preserve subsequent save directories as they are changed.

``figure.raise_window`` rcParam support
.......................................

The macosx backend will now obey the :rc:`figure.raise_window` setting. If set
to False, figure windows will not be raised to the top on update.

Full-screen toggle support
..........................

As supported on other backends, the macosx backend now supports toggling
fullscreen view. By default, this view can be toggled by pressing the :kbd:`f`
key.

Improved animation and blitting support
.......................................

The macosx backend has been improved to fix blitting, animation frames with new
artists, and to reduce unnecessary draw calls.

macOS application icon applied on Qt backend
--------------------------------------------

When using the Qt-based backends on macOS, the application icon will now be
set, as is done on other backends/platforms.

New minimum macOS version
-------------------------

The macosx backend now requires macOS >= 10.12.

Windows on ARM support
----------------------

Preliminary support for Windows on arm64 target has been added. This support
requires FreeType 2.11 or above.

No binary wheels are available yet but it may be built from source.
