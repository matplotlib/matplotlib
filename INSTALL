INTRODUCTION

  matplotlib requires at a minimum python 2.2+, Numeric or numarray
  and freetype.  To get the most out of matplotlib, you will want to
  build some of the optional GUI and image extensions, discussed
  below.  Matplotlib is known to work on linux, unix, win32 and OS X
  platforms.

  There are two kinds of matplotlib backends: vector based and raster
  based.  The vector based backends, SVG and PS, produce ASCII text
  output files *.svg and *.ps.  The core raster based renderer is the
  http://antigrain.com (agg) backend.  This is a high quality 2D
  library that supports fast antialiasing, alpha blending and much
  more.  If you want to produce PNGs or GUI images that support all of
  matplotlib's features, you should compile matplotlib with agg
  support and use one of the GUI agg backends: GTKAgg, WXAgg, TkAgg or
  FLTKAgg.   

COMPILING

  You will need to have recent versions of freetype (>= 2.1.7), libpng
  and zlib installed on your system.  If you are using a package
  manager, also make sure the devel versions of these packages are
  also installed (eg freetype-devel).

  The top of setup.py contains some flags controlling which backends
  will be built.  If you want to use a GUI backend, you will need
  either Tkinter, pygtk or wxpython installed on your system, from src
  or from a package manager including the devel packages.  You can
  choose which backends to enable by setting the flags in setup.py,
  but the 'auto' flags will work in most cases, as matplotlib tries to
  find a GUI and build the backend acccordingly.  If you know you
  don't want a particular backend or extension, you can set that flag
  to False.

  As discussed above, most users will want to set 'BUILD_AGG = 1' and
  one or more of the GUI backends to True.  Exceptions to this are if
  you know you don't need a GUI (eg a web server) or you only want to
  produce vector graphics. 

  If you have installed prerequisites to nonstandard places and need
  to inform matplotlib where they are, edit setupext.py an add the
  base dirs to the 'basedir' dictionary entry for your sys.platform.
  Eg, if the header to some required library is in
  /some/path/include/somheader.h, put /some/path in the basedir list
  for your platform.

  matplotlib works with with Numeric or numarray.  At compile time,
  setup.py will look for both packages and compile the appropriate
  extensions into matplotlib.  At runtime, the correct extension code
  will be chosen based on your numerix setting in matplotlibrc.  If
  you want to be able to use either Numeric or numarray efficiently
  with matplotlib, it is important that you have *both* present and in
  your PYTHONPATH when you compile matplotlib.

  Note that if you install matplotlib anywhere other than the default
  location, you will need to set the MATPLOTLIBDATA environment
  variable to point to the install base dir.
 
  Once you have everything above set to your liking, just do the usual
  thing

      python setup.py build
      python setup.py install
    
WINDOWS

  If you don't already have python installed, you may want to consider
  using the enthought edition of python, which has (old) scipy, Numeric, and
  wxpython, plus a lot of other goodies, preinstalled -
  http://www.enthought.com/python .  With the enthought edition of
  python + matplotlib installer, the following backends should work
  out of the box: agg, wx, wxagg, tkagg, ps and svg.

  For standard python installations, you will also need to install
  either numpy, Numeric or numarray in addition to the matplotlib installer.
  With a standard python + Numeric/numarray + matplotlib, the
  following backends should work on windows: agg, tkagg, ps, svg.  If
  you want others, eg a wx, wxagg, gtk or gtkagg, you'll need to
  install the requisite GUI toolkits.  This is fairly easy, as both
  wxpython and pygtk come with windows friendly installers.  The
  latter includes an additional requirement of the GTK runtime.

  All of the GUI backends run on windows, but TkAgg is probably the
  best for interactive use from the standard python shell or ipython.
  The windows installer (*.exe) on the download page contains all the
  code you need to get up and running.  However, there are many
  examples that are not included in the windows installer.  If you
  want to try the many demos that come in the matplotlib src
  distribution, download the zip file and look in the examples subdir.

  Important: There are known conflicts with some of the backends with
             some python IDEs such as pycrust, idle.  If you want to
             use matplotlib from an IDE, please consult
             http://matplotlib.sf.net/backends.html for compatibility
             information.  You will have the greatest likelihood of
             success if you run the examples from the command shell or
             by double clicking on them, rather than from an IDE.  If
             you are interactively generating plots, your best bet is
             TkAgg from the standard python shell or ipython.

DISTROS: (rpms, apt, fink, osx, freebsd, gentoo, etc)

  RPMS

    To build all the backends on a binary linux distro such as redhat,
    you need to install a number of the devel libs (and whatever
    dependencies they require), I suggest
 
      matplotlib core: zlib, zlib-devel, libpng, libpng-devel,
                       freetype, freetype-devel, freetype-utils

      gtk backend: gtk2-devel, gtk+-devel, pygtk2, glib-devel,
                   pygtk2-devel, gnome-libs-devel, pygtk2-libglade

      tk backend: tcl, tk, tkinter

  DEBIAN

    Vittorio Palmisano <redclay@email.it> maintails the debian
    packages at http://mentors.debian.net


    * add this lines to your /etc/apt/sources.list:
      deb http://anakonda.altervista.org/debian packages/
      deb-src http://anakonda.altervista.org/debian sources/

    * then run:
      # apt-get update
      # apt-get install python-matplotlib python-matplotlib-doc

  FREEBSD

  Gentoo
 
    http://www.gentoo-portage.com/dev-python/matplotlib

  OS X

    All of the backends run on OS X.  You will need to install
    freetype2, libpng and zlib via fink or from src.  You will also
    need the base libraries for a given backend.  Eg, if you want to
    run TkAgg, you will need a python with Tkinter; if you want to use
    WxAgg, install wxpython.  See
    http://matplotlib.sf.net/backends.html for a more comprehensive
    discussion of the various backend requirements.  Edit setup.py to
    configure the backends you want to build as described above.

    Note when running a GUI backend in OSX, you should launch your
    programs with pythonw rather than python, or you may get
    nonresponsive GUIs.

  FINK

    fink users should use Jeffrey Whitaker's fink distribution, which
    supports the GTK, TkAgg, GTKAgg, PS, WX, WXAgg and Agg backends.
