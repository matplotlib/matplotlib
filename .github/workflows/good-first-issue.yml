            ### Good first issue - notes for new contributors

            This issue is suited to new contributors because it does not require understanding of the
            Matplotlib internals. To get started, please see our [contributing
            guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/devel/index).

            **We do not assign issues**. Check the *Development* section in the sidebar for linked pull
            requests (PRs). If there are none, feel free to start working on it. If there is an open PR, please
            collaborate on the work by reviewing it rather than duplicating it in a competing PR.

            If something is unclear, please reach out on any of our [communication
            channels](https://matplotlib.org/stable/devel/contributing.html#get-connected).
