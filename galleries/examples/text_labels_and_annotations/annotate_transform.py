==================================
Annotation transforms (deprecated)
==================================

This example previously demonstrated annotation using display coordinates.
However, display coordinates are resolution-dependent and can lead to
unexpected results on high-DPI displays.

For most use cases, annotation should be done using data or axes coordinates.

Please see the Annotation tutorial and examples instead:
