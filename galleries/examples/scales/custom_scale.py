Custom scale
============

Custom scales can be created in two ways

#. For simple cases, use `~.scale.FuncScale` and the ``'function'`` option of
   `~.Axes.set_xscale` and `~.Axes.set_yscale`.  See the last example in
   :doc:`/gallery/scales/scales`.

#. Create a custom scale class such as the one in this example, which implements
   the scaling use for latitude data in a Mercator Projection.  This more complicated
   approach is useful when

   * You are making special use of the `.Transform` class, such as the special
     handling of values beyond the threshold in ``MercatorLatitudeTransform``
     below.

   * You want to override the default locators and formatters for the axis
     (``set_default_locators_and_formatters`` below).

   * You want to limit the range of the the axis (``limit_range_for_scale`` below).
