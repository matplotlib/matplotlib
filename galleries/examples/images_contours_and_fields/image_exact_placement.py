Placing images, preserving relative sizes
=========================================

By default Matplotlib resamples images created with `~.Axes.imshow` to
fit inside the parent `~.axes.Axes`.  This can mean that images that have very
different original sizes can end up appearing similar in size.

This example shows how to keep the images the same relative size, or
how to make the images keep exactly the same pixels as the original data.

Preserving relative sizes
=========================

By default the two images are made a similar size, despite one being 1.5 times the width
of the other:

import matplotlib.patches as mpatches

# make the data:
N = 450
x = np.arange(N) / N
y = np.arange(N) / N

X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)
f0 = 5
k = 100
a = np.sin(np.pi * 2 * (f0 * R + k * R**2 / 2))
A = a[:100, :300]
B = A[:40, :200]

# default layout: both axes have the same size
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, facecolor='aliceblue')

axs[0].imshow(A, vmin=-1, vmax=1)
axs[1].imshow(B, vmin=-1, vmax=1)


def annotate_rect(ax):
    # add a rectangle that is the size of the B matrix
    rect = mpatches.Rectangle((0, 0), 200, 40, linewidth=1,

# %%
# Note that both images have an aspect ratio of 1 (i.e. pixels are square), but
# pixels sizes differ because the images are scaled to the same width.
#
# If the size of the images are amenable, we can preserve the relative sizes of two
# images by using either the *width_ratio* or *height_ratio* of the subplots.  Which
# one you use depends on the shape of the image and the size of the figure.
# We can control the relative sizes using the *width_ratios* argument *if* the images
# are wider than they are tall and shown side by side, as is the case here.
#
# While we are making changes, let us also make the aspect ratio of the figure closer
# to the aspect ratio of the axes using *figsize* so that the figure does not have so
# much white space. Note that you could alternatively trim extra blank space when
# saving a figure by passing ``bbox_inches="tight"`` to `~.Figure.savefig`.

axs[1].imshow(B, vmin=-1, vmax=1)
# %%
# Given that the data subsample is in the upper left of the larger image,
# it might make sense if the top of the smaller Axes aligned with the top of the larger.
# This can be done manually by using `~.Axes.set_anchor`, and using "NW" (for
# northwest).

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, width_ratios=[300/200, 1],
                        figsize=(6.4, 2), facecolor='aliceblue')

# Explicit placement
# ==================
# The above approach with adjusting ``figsize`` and ``width_ratios`` does
# not generalize well, because it needs manual parameter tuning, and
# possibly even code changes to using ``height_ratios`` instead of
# ``width_ratios`` depending on the aspects and layout of the images.
#
# We can alternative calculate positions explicitly and place Axes at absolute
# coordinates using `~.Figure.add_axes`. This takes the position in the form
# ``[left bottom width height]`` and is in
# :ref:`figure coordinates <transforms_tutorial>`. In the following, we
# determine figure size and Axes positions so that one image data point
# is rendered exactly to one figure pixel.

dpi = 100  # 100 pixels is one inch

# All variables from here are in pixels:
buffer = 0.35 * dpi  # pixels

# Get the position of A axes
left = buffer
bottom = buffer
ny, nx = np.shape(A)
posA = [left, bottom, nx, ny]
# we know this is tallest, so we can already get the fig height (in pixels)
fig_height = bottom + ny + buffer

# place the B axes to the right of the A axes
left = left + nx + buffer

ny, nx = np.shape(B)
# align the bottom so that the top lines up with the top of the A axes:
bottom = fig_height - buffer - ny
posB = [left, bottom, nx, ny]

# now we can get the fig width (in pixels)
fig_width = left + nx + buffer

# figsize must be in inches:
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(fig_width / dpi, fig_height / dpi), facecolor='aliceblue')

# the position posA must be normalized by the figure width and height:
ax = fig.add_axes([posA[0] / fig_width, posA[1] / fig_height,
                   posA[2] / fig_width, posA[3] / fig_height])
ax.imshow(A, vmin=-1, vmax=1)
annotate_rect(ax)

ax = fig.add_axes([posB[0] / fig_width, posB[1] / fig_height,
                   posB[2] / fig_width, posB[3] / fig_height])
ax.imshow(B, vmin=-1, vmax=1)
plt.show()
# %%
# Inspection of the image will show that it is exactly 3* 35 + 300 + 200 = 605
# pixels wide, and 2 * 35 + 100 = 170 pixels high (or twice that if the 2x
# version is used by the browser instead).  The images should be rendered with
# exactly 1 pixel per data point (or four, if 2x).
