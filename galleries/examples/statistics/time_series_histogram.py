Time Series Histogram
=====================

This example demonstrates how to efficiently visualize large numbers of time
series in a way that could potentially reveal hidden substructure and patterns
that are not immediately obvious, and display them in a visually appealing way.

In this example, we generate multiple sinusoidal "signal" series that are
buried under a larger number of random walk "noise/background" series. For an
unbiased Gaussian random walk with standard deviation of σ, the RMS deviation
from the origin after n steps is σ*sqrt(n). So in order to keep the sinusoids
visible on the same scale as the random walks, we scale the amplitude by the
random walk RMS. In addition, we also introduce a small random offset ``phi``
to shift the sines left/right, and some additive random noise to shift
individual data points up/down to make the signal a bit more "realistic" (you
wouldn't expect a perfect sine wave to appear in your data).

The first plot shows the typical way of visualizing multiple time series by
overlaying them on top of each other with ``plt.plot`` and a small value of
``alpha``. The second and third plots show how to reinterpret the data as a 2d
histogram, with optional interpolation between data points, by using
``np.histogram2d`` and ``plt.pcolormesh``.
