Almost all objects you interact with on a Matplotlib plot are called "Artist"
(and are subclasses of the `.Artist` class).  :doc:`Figure <../figure/index>`
and :doc:`Axes <../axes/index>` are Artists, and generally contain
`~.axis.Axis` Artists and Artists that contain data or annotation information.
