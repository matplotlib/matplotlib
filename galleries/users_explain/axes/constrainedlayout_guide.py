========================
Constrained layout guide
========================

Use *constrained layout* to fit plots within your figure cleanly.

*Constrained layout* automatically adjusts subplots so that decorations like tick
labels, legends, and colorbars do not overlap, while still preserving the
logical layout requested by the user.

*Constrained layout* is similar to :ref:`Tight
layout<tight_layout_guide>`, but is substantially more
flexible.  It handles colorbars placed on multiple Axes
(:ref:`colorbar_placement`) nested layouts (`~.Figure.subfigures`) and Axes that
span rows or columns (`~.pyplot.subplot_mosaic`), striving to align spines from
Axes in the same row or column.  In addition, :ref:`Compressed layout
<compressed_layout>` will try and move fixed aspect-ratio Axes closer together.
These features are described in this document, as well as some
:ref:`implementation details <cl_notes_on_algorithm>` discussed at the end.

*Constrained layout* typically needs to be activated before any Axes are added to
a figure. Two ways of doing so are

* using the respective argument to `~.pyplot.subplots`,
  `~.pyplot.figure`, `~.pyplot.subplot_mosaic` e.g.::

      plt.subplots(layout="constrained")

* activate it via :ref:`rcParams<customizing-with-dynamic-rc-settings>`, like::

      plt.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True

Those are described in detail throughout the following sections.

.. warning::

    Calling `~.pyplot.tight_layout` will turn off *constrained layout*!

Simple example
==============

With the default Axes positioning, the axes title, axis labels, or tick labels
can sometimes go outside the figure area, and thus get clipped.

# Colorbars
# =========

# for improving the layout via ``tight_layout``.

# Legends
# =======

# In order for a legend or other artist to *not* steal space
# from the subplot layout, we can ``leg.set_in_layout(False)``.
# Of course this can mean the legend ends up
# cropped, but can be useful if the plot is subsequently called
# with ``fig.savefig('outname.png', bbox_inches='tight')``.  Note,

# %%
# Spacing between subplots is further set by *wspace* and *hspace*. These
# are specified as a fraction of the size of the subplot group as a whole.
# If these values are smaller than *w_pad* or *h_pad*, then the fixed pads are
# used instead. Note in the below how the space at the edges doesn't change

# Spacing with colorbars
# -----------------------

# %%
# Manually setting Axes positions
# ================================
#
# There can be good reasons to manually set an Axes position.  A manual call
# to `~.axes.Axes.set_position` will set the Axes so *constrained layout* has
# no effect on it anymore. (Note that *constrained layout* still leaves the

# %%
# .. _compressed_layout:
#
# Grids of fixed aspect-ratio Axes: "compressed" layout
# =====================================================
#
# *Constrained layout* operates on the grid of "original" positions for
# Axes. However, when Axes have fixed aspect ratios, one side is usually made
# shorter, and leaves large gaps in the shortened direction. In the following,
# the Axes are square, but the figure quite wide so there is a horizontal gap:

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(5, 3),
                        sharex=True, sharey=True, layout="constrained")
for ax in axs.flat:
    ax.imshow(arr)
fig.suptitle("fixed-aspect plots, layout='constrained'")

# %%
# One obvious way of fixing this is to make the figure size more square,
# however, closing the gaps exactly requires trial and error.  For simple grids
# of Axes we can use ``layout="compressed"`` to do the job for us:

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(5, 3),
                        sharex=True, sharey=True, layout='compressed')
for ax in axs.flat:
    ax.imshow(arr)
fig.suptitle("fixed-aspect plots, layout='compressed'")


# %%
# Manually turning off *constrained layout*
# ===========================================
#
# *Constrained layout* usually adjusts the Axes positions on each draw
# of the figure.  If you want to get the spacing provided by
# *constrained layout* but not have it update, then do the initial
# draw and then call ``fig.set_layout_engine('none')``.
# This is potentially useful for animations where the tick labels may
# change length.
#
# Note that *constrained layout* is turned off for ``ZOOM`` and ``PAN``
# GUI events for the backends that use the toolbar.  This prevents the
# Axes from changing position during zooming and panning.
#
#
# Limitations
# ===========
#
# Incompatible functions
# ----------------------
#
# *Constrained layout* will work with `.pyplot.subplot`, but only if the
# number of rows and columns is the same for each call.
# The reason is that each call to `.pyplot.subplot` will create a new
# `.GridSpec` instance if the geometry is not the same, and
# *constrained layout*.  So the following works fine:

fig = plt.figure(layout="constrained")

ax1 = plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
ax2 = plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
# third Axes that spans both rows in second column:
ax3 = plt.subplot(2, 2, (2, 4))

example_plot(ax1)
example_plot(ax2)
example_plot(ax3)
plt.suptitle('Homogeneous nrows, ncols')

# %%
# but the following leads to a poor layout:

fig = plt.figure(layout="constrained")

ax1 = plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
ax2 = plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
ax3 = plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)

example_plot(ax1)
example_plot(ax2)
example_plot(ax3)
plt.suptitle('Mixed nrows, ncols')

# %%
# Similarly,
# `~matplotlib.pyplot.subplot2grid` works with the same limitation
# that nrows and ncols cannot change for the layout to look good.

fig = plt.figure(layout="constrained")

ax1 = plt.subplot2grid((3, 3), (0, 0))
ax2 = plt.subplot2grid((3, 3), (0, 1), colspan=2)
ax3 = plt.subplot2grid((3, 3), (1, 0), colspan=2, rowspan=2)
ax4 = plt.subplot2grid((3, 3), (1, 2), rowspan=2)

example_plot(ax1)
example_plot(ax2)
example_plot(ax3)
example_plot(ax4)
fig.suptitle('subplot2grid')

# %%
# Other caveats
# -------------
#
# * *Constrained layout* only considers ticklabels, axis labels, titles, and
#   legends.  Thus, other artists may be clipped and also may overlap.
#
# * It assumes that the extra space needed for ticklabels, axis labels,
#   and titles is independent of original location of Axes. This is
#   often true, but there are rare cases where it is not.
#
# * There are small differences in how the backends handle rendering fonts,
#   so the results will not be pixel-identical.
#
# * An artist using Axes coordinates that extend beyond the Axes
#   boundary will result in unusual layouts when added to an
#   Axes. This can be avoided by adding the artist directly to the
#   :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure` using
#   :meth:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure.add_artist`. See
#   :class:`~matplotlib.patches.ConnectionPatch` for an example.

# %%
# Debugging
# =========
#
# *Constrained layout* can fail in somewhat unexpected ways.  Because it uses
# a constraint solver the solver can find solutions that are mathematically
# correct, but that aren't at all what the user wants.  The usual failure
# mode is for all sizes to collapse to their smallest allowable value. If
# this happens, it is for one of two reasons:
#
# 1. There was not enough room for the elements you were requesting to draw.
# 2. There is a bug - in which case open an issue at
#    https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues.
#
# If there is a bug, please report with a self-contained example that does
# not require outside data or dependencies (other than numpy).

# %%
# .. _cl_notes_on_algorithm:
#
# Notes on the algorithm
# ======================
#
# The algorithm for the constraint is relatively straightforward, but
# has some complexity due to the complex ways we can lay out a figure.
#
# Layout in Matplotlib is carried out with gridspecs
# via the `.GridSpec` class. A gridspec is a logical division of the figure
# into rows and columns, with the relative width of the Axes in those
# rows and columns set by *width_ratios* and *height_ratios*.
#
# In *constrained layout*, each gridspec gets a *layoutgrid* associated with
# it.  The *layoutgrid* has a series of ``left`` and ``right`` variables
# for each column, and ``bottom`` and ``top`` variables for each row, and
# further it has a margin for each of left, right, bottom and top.  In each
# row, the bottom/top margins are widened until all the decorators
# in that row are accommodated.  Similarly, for columns and the left/right
# margins.
#
#
# Simple case: one Axes
# ---------------------
#
# For a single Axes the layout is straight forward.  There is one parent
# layoutgrid for the figure consisting of one column and row, and
# a child layoutgrid for the gridspec that contains the Axes, again
# consisting of one row and column. Space is made for the "decorations" on
# each side of the Axes.  In the code, this is accomplished by the entries in
# ``do_constrained_layout()`` like::
#
#     gridspec._layoutgrid[0, 0].edit_margin_min('left',
#           -bbox.x0 + pos.x0 + w_pad)
#
# where ``bbox`` is the tight bounding box of the Axes, and ``pos`` its
# position.  Note how the four margins encompass the Axes decorations.

# %%
# Simple case: two Axes
# ---------------------
# When there are multiple Axes they have their layouts bound in
# simple ways.  In this example the left Axes has much larger decorations
# than the right, but they share a bottom margin, which is made large
# enough to accommodate the larger xlabel.   Same with the shared top
# margin.  The left and right margins are not shared, and hence are
# allowed to be different.

# Uneven sized Axes
# -----------------
#
# There are two ways to make Axes have an uneven size in a
# Gridspec layout, either by specifying them to cross Gridspecs rows
# or columns, or by specifying width and height ratios.
#
# The first method is used here.  Note that the middle ``top`` and
# ``bottom`` margins are not affected by the left-hand column.  This
# is a conscious decision of the algorithm, and leads to the case where
# the two right-hand Axes have the same height, but it is not 1/2 the height
# of the left-hand Axes.  This is consistent with how ``gridspec`` works
# without *constrained layout*.

fig = plt.figure(layout="constrained")
gs = gridspec.GridSpec(2, 2, figure=fig)
ax = fig.add_subplot(gs[:, 0])
im = ax.pcolormesh(arr, **pc_kwargs)
ax = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 1])
im = ax.pcolormesh(arr, **pc_kwargs)
ax = fig.add_subplot(gs[1, 1])
im = ax.pcolormesh(arr, **pc_kwargs)
plot_children(fig)

# %%
# One case that requires finessing is if margins do not have any artists
# constraining their width. In the case below, the right margin for column 0
# and the left margin for column 3 have no margin artists to set their width,
# so we take the maximum width of the margin widths that do have artists.
# This makes all the Axes have the same size:

fig = plt.figure(layout="constrained")
gs = fig.add_gridspec(2, 4)
ax00 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0:2])
ax01 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 2:])
ax10 = fig.add_subplot(gs[1, 1:3])
example_plot(ax10, fontsize=14)
