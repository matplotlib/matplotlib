Introduction to Axes (or Subplots)

Matplotlib `~.axes.Axes` are the gateway to creating your data visualizations.
Once an Axes is placed on a figure there are many methods that can be used to
add data to the Axes. An Axes typically has a pair of `~.axis.Axis`
Artists that define the data coordinate system, and include methods to add
annotations like x- and y-labels, titles, and legends.

    Anatomy of a Figure

In the picture above, the Axes object was created with ``ax = fig.subplots()``.
Everything else on the figure was created with methods on this ``ax`` object,
or can be accessed from it.  If we want to change the label on the x-axis, we
call ``ax.set_xlabel('New Label')``, if we want to plot some data we call
``ax.plot(x, y)``.  Indeed, in the figure above, the only Artist that is not
part of the Axes is the Figure itself, so the `.axes.Axes` class is really the
gateway to much of Matplotlib's functionality.

Note that Axes are so fundamental to the operation of Matplotlib that a lot of
material here is duplicate of that in :ref:`quick_start`.

Creating Axes
-------------

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=2, figsize=(3.5, 2.5),
                            layout="constrained")
    # for each Axes, add an artist, in this case a nice label in the middle...
    for row in range(2):
        for col in range(2):
            axs[row, col].annotate(f'axs[{row}, {col}]', (0.5, 0.5),
                                transform=axs[row, col].transAxes,
                                ha='center', va='center', fontsize=18,
                                color='darkgrey')
    fig.suptitle('plt.subplots()')


Axes are added using methods on `~.Figure` objects, or via the `~.pyplot` interface.  These methods are discussed in more detail in :ref:`creating_figures` and :doc:`arranging_axes`. However, for instance `~.Figure.add_axes` will manually position an Axes on the page. In the example above `~.pyplot.subplots` put a grid of subplots on the figure, and ``axs`` is a (2, 2) array of Axes, each of which can have data added to them.

There are a number of other methods for adding Axes to a Figure:

* `.Figure.add_axes`: manually position an Axes. ``fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1,
  1])`` makes an Axes that fills the whole figure.
* `.pyplot.subplots` and `.Figure.subplots`: add a grid of Axes as in the example
  above.  The pyplot version returns both the Figure object and an array of
  Axes.  Note that ``fig, ax = plt.subplots()`` adds a single Axes to a Figure.
* `.pyplot.subplot_mosaic` and `.Figure.subplot_mosaic`: add a grid of named
  Axes and return a dictionary of axes.  For ``fig, axs =
  plt.subplot_mosaic([['left', 'right'], ['bottom', 'bottom']])``,
  ``axs['left']`` is an Axes in the top row on the left, and ``axs['bottom']``
  is an Axes that spans both columns on the bottom.

See :doc:`arranging_axes` for more detail on how to arrange grids of Axes on a
Figure.


Axes plotting methods
---------------------

Most of the high-level plotting methods are accessed from the `.axes.Axes`
class.  See the API documentation for a full curated list, and
:ref:`plot_types` for examples.  A basic example is `.axes.Axes.plot`:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 3))
    np.random.seed(19680801)
    t = np.arange(100)
    x = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(100))
    lines = ax.plot(t, x)

Note that ``plot`` returns a list of *lines* Artists which can subsequently be
manipulated, as discussed in :ref:`users_artists`.

A very incomplete list of plotting methods is below.  Again, see :ref:`plot_types`
for more examples, and `.axes.Axes` for the full list of methods.

                          `~.axes.Axes.bar`, `~.axes.Axes.step`,
:ref:`arrays`             `~.axes.Axes.pcolormesh`, `~.axes.Axes.contour`,

========================= ==================================================

Axes labelling and annotation
-----------------------------

Usually we want to label the Axes with an xlabel, ylabel, and title, and often we want to have a legend to differentiate plot elements.  The `~.axes.Axes` class has a number of methods to create these annotations.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3), layout='constrained')
    np.random.seed(19680801)
    t = np.arange(200)
    x = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(200))
    y = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(200))
    linesx = ax.plot(t, x, label='Random walk x')
    linesy = ax.plot(t, y, label='Random walk y')

    ax.set_xlabel('Time [s]')
    ax.set_ylabel('Distance [km]')
    ax.set_title('Random walk example')
    ax.legend()

These methods are relatively straight-forward, though there are a number of :ref:`text_props` that can be set on the text objects, like *fontsize*, *fontname*, *horizontalalignment*.  Legends can be much more complicated; see :ref:`legend_guide` for more details.

Note that text can also be added to axes using `~.axes.Axes.text`, and `~.axes.Axes.annotate`.  This can be quite sophisticated: see :ref:`text_props` and :ref:`annotations` for more information.


Axes limits, scales, and ticking
--------------------------------

Each Axes has two (or more) `~.axis.Axis` objects, that can be accessed via :attr:`!matplotlib.axes.Axes.xaxis` and :attr:`!matplotlib.axes.Axes.yaxis` properties.  These have substantial number of methods on them, and for highly customizable Axis-es it is useful to read the API at `~.axis.Axis`.   However, the Axes class offers a number of helpers for the most common of these methods.  Indeed, the `~.axes.Axes.set_xlabel`, discussed above, is a helper for the `~.Axis.set_label_text`.

Other important methods set the extent on the axes (`~.axes.Axes.set_xlim`, `~.axes.Axes.set_ylim`), or more fundamentally the scale of the axes.  So for instance, we can make an Axis have a logarithmic scale, and zoom in on a sub-portion of the data:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 2.5), layout='constrained')
    np.random.seed(19680801)
    t = np.arange(200)
    x = 2**np.cumsum(np.random.randn(200))
    linesx = ax.plot(t, x)
    ax.set_yscale('log')
    ax.set_xlim([20, 180])

The Axes class also has helpers to deal with Axis ticks and their labels.  Most straight-forward is `~.axes.Axes.set_xticks` and `~.axes.Axes.set_yticks` which manually set the tick locations and optionally their labels.  Minor ticks can be toggled with `~.axes.Axes.minorticks_on` or `~.axes.Axes.minorticks_off`.

Many aspects of Axes ticks and tick labeling can be adjusted using `~.axes.Axes.tick_params`. For instance, to label the top of the axes instead of the bottom,color the ticks red, and color the ticklabels green:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 2.5))
    ax.plot(np.arange(10))
    ax.tick_params(top=True, labeltop=True, color='red', axis='x',
                   labelcolor='green')


More fine-grained control on ticks, setting scales, and controlling the Axis can be highly customized beyond these Axes-level helpers.

Axes layout
-----------

Sometimes it is important to set the aspect ratio of a plot in data space, which we can do with `~.axes.Axes.set_aspect`:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(7, 2.5), layout='constrained')
    np.random.seed(19680801)
    t = np.arange(200)
    x = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(200))
    axs[0].plot(t, x)
    axs[0].set_title('aspect="auto"')

    axs[1].plot(t, x)
    axs[1].set_aspect(3)
    axs[1].set_title('aspect=3')
