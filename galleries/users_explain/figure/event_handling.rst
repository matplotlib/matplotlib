Event handling and picking
**************************

Matplotlib works with a number of user interface toolkits (wxpython,
tkinter, qt, gtk, and macOS) and in order to support features like
interactive panning and zooming of figures, it is helpful to the
developers to have an API for interacting with the figure via key
presses and mouse movements that is "GUI neutral" so we don't have to
repeat a lot of code across the different user interfaces.  Although
the event handling API is GUI neutral, it is based on the GTK model,
which was the first user interface Matplotlib supported.  The events
that are triggered are also a bit richer vis-a-vis Matplotlib than
standard GUI events, including information like which
`~.axes.Axes` the event occurred in.  The events also
understand the Matplotlib coordinate system, and report event
locations in both pixel and data coordinates.

.. _event-connections:

Event connections
=================

To receive events, you need to write a callback function and then
connect your function to the event manager, which is part of the
`~.FigureCanvasBase`.  Here is a simple
example that prints the location of the mouse click and which button
was pressed::

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(np.random.rand(10))

    def onclick(event):
        print('%s click: button=%d, x=%d, y=%d, xdata=%f, ydata=%f' %
              ('double' if event.dblclick else 'single', event.button,
               event.x, event.y, event.xdata, event.ydata))

    cid = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick)

The `.FigureCanvasBase.mpl_connect` method returns a connection id (an
integer), which can be used to disconnect the callback via ::

    fig.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)

.. note::
   The canvas retains only weak references to instance methods used as
   callbacks.  Therefore, you need to retain a reference to instances owning
   such methods.  Otherwise the instance will be garbage-collected and the
   callback will vanish.

   This does not affect free functions used as callbacks.

Here are the events that you can connect to, the class instances that
are sent back to you when the event occurs, and the event descriptions:

====================== ================ ======================================
Event name             Class            Description
====================== ================ ======================================
'button_press_event'   `.MouseEvent`    mouse button is pressed
'button_release_event' `.MouseEvent`    mouse button is released
'close_event'          `.CloseEvent`    figure is closed
'draw_event'           `.DrawEvent`     canvas has been drawn (but screen
                                        widget not updated yet)
'key_press_event'      `.KeyEvent`      key is pressed
'key_release_event'    `.KeyEvent`      key is released
'motion_notify_event'  `.MouseEvent`    mouse moves
'pick_event'           `.PickEvent`     artist in the canvas is selected
'resize_event'         `.ResizeEvent`   figure canvas is resized
'scroll_event'         `.MouseEvent`    mouse scroll wheel is rolled
'figure_enter_event'   `.LocationEvent` mouse enters a new figure
'figure_leave_event'   `.LocationEvent` mouse leaves a figure
'axes_enter_event'     `.LocationEvent` mouse enters a new axes
'axes_leave_event'     `.LocationEvent` mouse leaves an axes
====================== ================ ======================================

.. note::
   When connecting to 'key_press_event' and 'key_release_event' events,
   you may encounter inconsistencies between the different user interface
   toolkits that Matplotlib works with. This is due to inconsistencies/limitations
   of the user interface toolkit. The following table shows some basic examples of
   what you may expect to receive as key(s) (using a QWERTY keyboard layout)
   from the different user interface toolkits, where a comma separates different keys:

Matplotlib attaches some keypress callbacks by default for interactivity; they
are documented in the :ref:`key-event-handling` section.

.. _event-attributes:

Event attributes
================

All Matplotlib events inherit from the base class
`matplotlib.backend_bases.Event`, which stores the attributes:

``name``
    the event name
``canvas``
    the FigureCanvas instance generating the event
``guiEvent``
    the GUI event that triggered the Matplotlib event

The most common events that are the bread and butter of event handling
are key press/release events and mouse press/release and movement
events.  The `.KeyEvent` and `.MouseEvent` classes that handle
these events are both derived from the LocationEvent, which has the
following attributes

``x``, ``y``
    mouse x and y position in pixels from left and bottom of canvas
``inaxes``
    the `~.axes.Axes` instance over which the mouse is, if any; else None
``xdata``, ``ydata``
    mouse x and y position in data coordinates, if the mouse is over an
    axes

Let's look a simple example of a canvas, where a simple line segment
is created every time a mouse is pressed::

    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    class LineBuilder:
        def __init__(self, line):
            self.line = line
            self.xs = list(line.get_xdata())
            self.ys = list(line.get_ydata())
            self.cid = line.figure.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', self)

        def __call__(self, event):
            print('click', event)
            if event.inaxes != self.line.axes:
                return
            self.xs.append(event.xdata)
            self.ys.append(event.ydata)
            self.line.set_data(self.xs, self.ys)
            self.line.figure.canvas.draw()

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.set_title('click to build line segments')
    line, = ax.plot([0], [0])  # empty line
    linebuilder = LineBuilder(line)

    plt.show()

The `.MouseEvent` that we just used is a `.LocationEvent`, so we have access to
the data and pixel coordinates via ``(event.x, event.y)`` and ``(event.xdata,
event.ydata)``.  In addition to the ``LocationEvent`` attributes, it also has:

``button``
    the button pressed: None, `.MouseButton`, 'up', or 'down' (up and down are used for scroll events)

``key``
    the key pressed: None, any character, 'shift', 'win', or 'control'

Draggable rectangle exercise
----------------------------

Write a draggable rectangle class that is initialized with a
`.Rectangle` instance but will move its ``xy``
location when dragged.

Hint: You will need to store the original
``xy`` location of the rectangle which is stored as ``rect.xy`` and
connect to the press, motion and release mouse events.  When the mouse
is pressed, check to see if the click occurs over your rectangle (see
`.Rectangle.contains`) and if it does, store
the rectangle xy and the location of the mouse click in data coordinates.
In the motion event callback, compute the deltax and deltay of the
mouse movement, and add those deltas to the origin of the rectangle
you stored, then redraw the figure.  On the button release event, just
reset all the button press data you stored as None.

Here is the solution::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    class DraggableRectangle:
        def __init__(self, rect):
            self.rect = rect
            self.press = None

        def connect(self):
            """Connect to all the events we need."""
            self.cidpress = self.rect.figure.canvas.mpl_connect(
                'button_press_event', self.on_press)
            self.cidrelease = self.rect.figure.canvas.mpl_connect(
                'button_release_event', self.on_release)
            self.cidmotion = self.rect.figure.canvas.mpl_connect(
                'motion_notify_event', self.on_motion)

        def on_press(self, event):
            """Check whether mouse is over us; if so, store some data."""
            if event.inaxes != self.rect.axes:
                return
            contains, attrd = self.rect.contains(event)
            if not contains:
                return
            print('event contains', self.rect.xy)
            self.press = self.rect.xy, (event.xdata, event.ydata)

        def on_motion(self, event):
            """Move the rectangle if the mouse is over us."""
            if self.press is None or event.inaxes != self.rect.axes:
                return
            (x0, y0), (xpress, ypress) = self.press
            dx = event.xdata - xpress
            dy = event.ydata - ypress
            # print(f'x0={x0}, xpress={xpress}, event.xdata={event.xdata}, '
            #       f'dx={dx}, x0+dx={x0+dx}')
            self.rect.set_x(x0+dx)
            self.rect.set_y(y0+dy)

            self.rect.figure.canvas.draw()

        def on_release(self, event):
            """Clear button press information."""
            self.press = None
            self.rect.figure.canvas.draw()

        def disconnect(self):
            """Disconnect all callbacks."""
            self.rect.figure.canvas.mpl_disconnect(self.cidpress)
            self.rect.figure.canvas.mpl_disconnect(self.cidrelease)
            self.rect.figure.canvas.mpl_disconnect(self.cidmotion)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    rects = ax.bar(range(10), 20*np.random.rand(10))
    drs = []
    for rect in rects:
        dr = DraggableRectangle(rect)
        dr.connect()
        drs.append(dr)

    plt.show()

smoother.

a simple example that changes the colors of the axes and figure
background that the mouse is over::

    frame colors on enter and leave
    """
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    def enter_axes(event):

.. _object-picking:

Object picking
==============

You can enable picking by setting the ``picker`` property of an `.Artist` (such
as `.Line2D`, `.Text`, `.Patch`, `.Polygon`, `.AxesImage`, etc.)

The ``picker`` property can be set using various types:

``None``
    Picking is disabled for this artist (default).
``boolean``
    If True, then picking will be enabled and the artist will fire a
    pick event if the mouse event is over the artist.
``callable``
    If picker is a callable, it is a user supplied function which
    determines whether the artist is hit by the mouse event.  The
    signature is ``hit, props = picker(artist, mouseevent)`` to
    determine the hit test.  If the mouse event is over the artist,
    return ``hit = True``; ``props`` is a dictionary of properties that
    become additional attributes on the `.PickEvent`.

The artist's ``pickradius`` property can additionally be set to a tolerance
value in points (there are 72 points per inch) that determines how far the
mouse can be and still trigger a mouse event.

After you have enabled an artist for picking by setting the ``picker``
property, you need to connect a handler to the figure canvas pick_event to get
pick callbacks on mouse press events.  The handler typically looks like ::

    def pick_handler(event):

        # now do something with this...

The `.PickEvent` passed to your callback always has the following attributes:

``mouseevent``
    The `.MouseEvent` that generate the pick event.  See event-attributes_
    for a list of useful attributes on the mouse event.
``artist``
    The `.Artist` that generated the pick event.

Additionally, certain artists like `.Line2D` and `.PatchCollection` may attach
additional metadata, like the indices of the data that meet the
picker criteria (e.g., all the points in the line that are within the
specified ``pickradius`` tolerance).

Simple picking example
----------------------

In the example below, we enable picking on the line and set a pick radius
tolerance in points.  The ``onpick``
callback function will be called when the pick event it within the
tolerance distance from the line, and has the indices of the data
vertices that are within the pick distance tolerance.  Our ``onpick``
callback function simply prints the data that are under the pick
location.  Different Matplotlib Artists can attach different data to
the PickEvent.  For example, ``Line2D`` attaches the ind property,
which are the indices into the line data under the pick point.  See
`.Line2D.pick` for details on the ``PickEvent`` properties of the line.  ::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.set_title('click on points')

    line, = ax.plot(np.random.rand(100), 'o',
                    picker=True, pickradius=5)  # 5 points tolerance

    def onpick(event):
        thisline = event.artist
        xdata = thisline.get_xdata()
        ydata = thisline.get_ydata()
        ind = event.ind
        points = tuple(zip(xdata[ind], ydata[ind]))
        print('onpick points:', points)

    fig.canvas.mpl_connect('pick_event', onpick)

    plt.show()

Picking exercise
----------------

Create a data set of 100 arrays of 1000 Gaussian random numbers and
compute the sample mean and standard deviation of each of them (hint:
NumPy arrays have a mean and std method) and make a xy marker plot of
the 100 means vs. the 100 standard deviations.  Connect the line
created by the plot command to the pick event, and plot the original
time series of the data that generated the clicked on points.  If more
than one point is within the tolerance of the clicked on point, you
can use multiple subplots to plot the multiple time series.

Exercise solution::

    """
    Compute the mean and stddev of 100 data sets and plot mean vs. stddev.
    When you click on one of the (mean, stddev) points, plot the raw dataset
    that generated that point.
