Matplotlib Application Interfaces (APIs)
========================================

Matplotlib has two major application interfaces, or styles of using the library:

- An explicit "Axes" interface that uses methods on a Figure or Axes object to
  create other Artists, and build a visualization step by step.  This has also
  been called an "object-oriented" interface.
- An implicit "pyplot" interface that keeps track of the last Figure and Axes
  created, and adds Artists to the object it thinks the user wants.

In addition, a number of downstream libraries (like `pandas` and xarray_) offer
a ``plot`` method implemented directly on their data classes so that users can
call ``data.plot()``.

.. _xarray: https://xarray.pydata.org

The difference between these interfaces can be a bit confusing, particularly
given snippets on the web that use one or the other, or sometimes multiple
interfaces in the same example.  Here we attempt to point out how the "pyplot"
and downstream interfaces relate to the explicit "Axes" interface to help users
better navigate the library.


Native Matplotlib interfaces
----------------------------

The explicit "Axes" interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "Axes" interface is how Matplotlib is implemented, and many customizations
and fine-tuning end up being done at this level.

This interface works by instantiating an instance of a
`~.matplotlib.figure.Figure` class (``fig`` below), using a
`~.Figure.subplots` method (or similar) on that object to create one or more
`~.matplotlib.axes.Axes` objects (``ax`` below), and then calling drawing
methods on the Axes (``plot`` in this example):

.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :align: center

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.subplots()
    ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 0.5, 1, 0.2])

We call this an "explicit" interface because each object is explicitly
referenced, and used to make the next object.  Keeping references to the objects
is very flexible, and allows us to customize the objects after they are created,
but before they are displayed.


.. _pyplot_interface:

The implicit "pyplot" interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `~.matplotlib.pyplot` module shadows most of the
`~.matplotlib.axes.Axes` plotting methods to give the equivalent of
the above, where the creation of the Figure and Axes is done for the user:

.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :align: center

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 0.5, 1, 0.2])

This can be convenient, particularly when doing interactive work or simple
scripts.  A reference to the current Figure can be retrieved using
`~.pyplot.gcf` and to the current Axes by `~.pyplot.gca`.  The `~.pyplot` module
retains a list of Figures, and each Figure retains a list of Axes on the figure
for the user so that the following:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :align: center

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [0, 0.5, 0.2])

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    plt.plot([3, 2, 1], [0, 0.5, 0.2])

is equivalent to:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :align: center

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    ax = plt.gca()
    ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [0, 0.5, 0.2])

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    ax = plt.gca()
    ax.plot([3, 2, 1], [0, 0.5, 0.2])

In the explicit interface, this would be:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :align: center

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2)
    axs[0].plot([1, 2, 3], [0, 0.5, 0.2])
    axs[1].plot([3, 2, 1], [0, 0.5, 0.2])

Translating between the Axes interface and the pyplot interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You may find either interface in existing code, and unfortunately sometimes even
mixtures. This section describes the patterns for specific operations in both
interfaces and how to translate from one to the other.

- Creating figures is the same for both interfaces: Use the respective `.pyplot`
  functions ``plt.figure()``, ``plt.subplots()``, ``plt.subplot_mosaic()``.
  For the Axes interface, you typically store the created Figure (and possibly
  Axes) in variables for later use. When using the pyplot interface, these
  values are typically not stored. Example:

  - Axes: ``fig, ax = plt.subplots()``
  - pyplot: ``plt.subplots()``

- "Plotting" functions, i.e. functions that add data, are named the same and
  have identical parameters on the Axes and in pyplot. Example:

  - Axes: ``ax.plot(x, y)``
  - pyplot: ``plt.plot(x, y)``

- Functions that retrieve properties are named like the property in pyplot
  and are prefixed with ``get_`` on the Axes. Example:

  - Axes: ``label = ax.get_xlabel()``
  - pyplot: ``label = plt.xlabel()``

- Functions that set properties like the property in pyplot and are prefixed with
  ``set_`` on the Axes. Example:

  - Axes: ``ax.set_xlabel("time")``
  - pyplot: ``plt.xlabel("time")``

Here is a short summary of the examples again as a side-by-side comparison:

==================   ============================   ========================
Operation            Axes interface                 pyplot interface
==================   ============================   ========================
Creating figures     ``fig, ax = plt.subplots()``   ``plt.subplots()``
Plotting data        ``ax.plot(x, y)``              ``plt.plot(x, y)``
Getting properties   ``label = ax.get_xlabel()``    ``label = plt.xlabel()``
Setting properties   ``ax.set_xlabel("time")``      ``plt.xlabel("time")``
==================   ============================   ========================


Why be explicit?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What happens if you have to backtrack, and operate on an old axes that is not
referenced by ``plt.gca()``?  One simple way is to call ``subplot`` again with
the same arguments.  However, that quickly becomes inelegant.  You can also
inspect the Figure object and get its list of Axes objects, however, that can be
misleading (colorbars are Axes too!). The best solution is probably to save a
handle to every Axes you create, but if you do that, why not simply create the
all the Axes objects at the start?

The first approach is to call ``plt.subplot`` again:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :align: center

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [0, 0.5, 0.2])

    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    plt.plot([3, 2, 1], [0, 0.5, 0.2])

    plt.suptitle('Implicit Interface: re-call subplot')

    for i in range(1, 3):
        plt.subplot(1, 2, i)
        plt.xlabel('Boo')

The second is to save a handle:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :align: center

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    axs = []
    ax = plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    axs += [ax]
    plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [0, 0.5, 0.2])

    ax = plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    axs += [ax]
    plt.plot([3, 2, 1], [0, 0.5, 0.2])

    plt.suptitle('Implicit Interface: save handles')

    for i in range(2):
        plt.sca(axs[i])
        plt.xlabel('Boo')

However, the recommended way would be to be explicit from the outset:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :align: center

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2)
    axs[0].plot([1, 2, 3], [0, 0.5, 0.2])
    axs[1].plot([3, 2, 1], [0, 0.5, 0.2])
    fig.suptitle('Explicit Interface')
    for i in range(2):
        axs[i].set_xlabel('Boo')


Third-party library "Data-object" interfaces
--------------------------------------------

Some third party libraries have chosen to implement plotting for their data
objects, e.g. ``data.plot()``, is seen in `pandas`, xarray_, and other
third-party libraries.  For illustrative purposes, a downstream library may
implement a simple data container that has ``x`` and ``y`` data stored together,
and then implements a ``plot`` method:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :align: center

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # supplied by downstream library:
    class DataContainer:

        def __init__(self, x, y):
            """
            Proper docstring here!
            """
            self._x = x
            self._y = y

        def plot(self, ax=None, **kwargs):
            if ax is None:
                ax = plt.gca()
            ax.plot(self._x, self._y, **kwargs)
            ax.set_title('Plotted from DataClass!')
            return ax


    # what the user usually calls:
    data = DataContainer([0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.3])
    data.plot()

So the library can hide all the nitty-gritty from the user, and can make a
visualization appropriate to the data type, often with good labels, choices of
colormaps, and other convenient features.

In the above, however, we may not have liked the title the library provided.
Thankfully, they pass us back the Axes from the ``plot()`` method, and
understanding the explicit Axes interface, we could call:
``ax.set_title('My preferred title')`` to customize the title.

Many libraries also allow their ``plot`` methods to accept an optional *ax*
argument. This allows us to place the visualization in an Axes that we have
placed and perhaps customized.

Summary
-------

Overall, it is useful to understand the explicit "Axes" interface since it is
the most flexible and underlies the other interfaces.  A user can usually
figure out how to drop down to the explicit interface and operate on the
underlying objects.  While the explicit interface can be a bit more verbose
to setup, complicated plots will often end up simpler than trying to use
the implicit "pyplot" interface.

.. note::

    It is sometimes confusing to people that we import ``pyplot`` for both
    interfaces.  Currently, the ``pyplot`` module implements the "pyplot"
    interface, but it also provides top-level Figure and Axes creation
    methods, and ultimately spins up the graphical user interface, if one
    is being used.  So ``pyplot`` is still needed regardless of the
    interface chosen.

Similarly, the declarative interfaces provided by partner libraries use the
objects accessible by the "Axes" interface, and often accept these as arguments
or pass them back from methods.  It is usually essential to use the explicit
"Axes" interface to perform any customization of the default visualization, or
to unpack the data into NumPy arrays and pass directly to Matplotlib.

Appendix: "Axes" interface with data structures
-----------------------------------------------

Most `~.axes.Axes` methods allow yet another API addressing by passing a
*data* object to the method and specifying the arguments as strings:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :align: center

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    data = {'xdat': [0, 1, 2, 3], 'ydat': [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1]}
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(2, 2))
    ax.plot('xdat', 'ydat', data=data)


Appendix: "pylab" interface
---------------------------

There is one further interface that is highly discouraged, and that is to
basically do ``from matplotlib.pylab import *``. This imports all the
functions from ``matplotlib.pyplot``, ``numpy``, ``numpy.fft``, ``numpy.linalg``, and
``numpy.random``, and some additional functions into the global namespace.

Such a pattern is considered bad practice in modern python, as it clutters
the global namespace. Even more severely, in the case of ``pylab``, this will
overwrite some builtin functions (e.g. the builtin ``sum`` will be replaced by
``numpy.sum``), which can lead to unexpected behavior.
