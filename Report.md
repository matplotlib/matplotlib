# Report for assignment 3

## Project:

Name: Matplotlib

URL: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib

Matplotlib is a Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## 3.3 Onboarding: 
#### 1. How easily can you build the project? Briefly describe if everything worked as documented or not:
a) Yes, the project requires a lot of dependencies with a provided developer guide to install and build the project.  

b) The tools are mostly well documented with a dedicated website. However, many of the functions have limited documentation where no guidance is provided while some functions have incredibly detailed comments that describe both the purpose of the function but also the intricacies of all of its arguments.  

c) The components were installed automatically from a list of dependencies but it required a few different steps with a virtual environment where these dependencies could be installed.  

d) The build concluded without errors for two of us in the group while three others did not manage to install all the dependencies and build the project.
The examples and tests run mostly as intended with very few tests failing out of about 8000 tests.

#### 2. Do you plan to continue or choose another project?  
We plan to continue with the matplotlib repository where we firstly choose an algorithm collection for python where the tests were very scarce and used an unfamiliar framework. Matplotlib was the first repo that somewhat worked for the group and we did not have time to change it for the time-frame of the assignment.


## 3.4 Part 1: Complexity measurement
#### 1. What are your results? Did everyone get the same result? Is there something that is unclear? If you have a tool, is its result the same as yours?
 
We used lizard to count the cyclomatic complexity and the entire result for the functions can be found [here](link to the file). The results for the specific functions that we choose are:

These are the lizard results for our 10 chosen functions, the entire list can be found [here](link) to all the functions.

These are the lizard results for our 10 chosen functions, the entire list can be found [here](./lib/matplotlib/lizardInitRes.txt), the entire list can be found [here](link) to all the functions.
The results were generated by running this command:  
`lizard ./ -x"./tests/*" -x"./testing/*" > lizardInitRes.txt`  
From the `./lib/matplotlib` directory which avoids the test-files.

```

The results with our own calculations seem to be a tiny bit off the results of lizard with +-1 in the cyclomatic complexity number where these results are most likely due to our inexperience with counting this complexity and python-specific syntax that could be counted as a branch etc. 

#### 2. Are the functions/methods with high CC also very long in terms of LOC?
The functions with high CC are in most cases also very long in LOC but there are exceptions with shorter functions that involve a lot of branches. There are also functions with lots of lines which do not have a high CCN.

#### 3. What is the purpose of these functions? Is it related to the high CC?
##### Pontus: 
the function `get_tight_layout_figure()` returns a subplot parameter for tight-layouted-figure with specified padding. It has quite a few if statements to decide these parameters and to warn if the inputs are not safe and otherwise its for loops to initialize lists. I guess this is needed to compute the parameters so I would say it’s related.

The purpose of the function _parse_legend_args() is to get the handles and labels from the calls to either ``figure.legend`` or ``axes.legend``. To do this it needs to verify that the argos and handles are valid which is the cause of the high CCN.


##### Jonas: 

The purpose of the `hist()` function is to compute and plot a histogram by preparing the input data for use in the NumPy library as well as add additional functionality and customizations to the histogram plot with its various arguments. It is highly related to CC with what I would say a reasonable complexity number since a histogram can include various different arguments and allowing for various types of customization to the plotted histogram naturally requires a lot of branching in the code to perform the corresponding actions.

The purpose of the `subsuper()` function lacks any form of documentation within the code or on the dedicated website but with analysis of the code I assume that the function allows plots to include both subscripts and superscripts to correctly write the mathematical language. Its relation to CC seems very reasonable since it has to interact graphically with the plots and correctly perform the subscript and superscript to the provided text. 

##### Klara: 

The `streamplot()` function is the main function of its class and includes a lot of the basic functions of streamline plotting for 2D vector fields. In its documentation it is described to neither be complete or updated and is set as “will be updated in the future”, which is probably the explanation for it having a high complexity number.

The purpose of the `_keypress()` function in the widgets.py class is to handle key inputs to the widgets. This function basically consists of if-cases for all of the supported keypress cases and thus will naturally have a higher complexity.

##### Ahmad:

The `boxplot()`  function is for creating a box and whisker plot using the Matplotlib library. The function takes in several optional parameters that can be used to customize the plot, such as the position and width of the boxes, the appearance of the outliers, and the color and style of the plot elements.

The `_apply_params()` function sets various properties of an axis in a matplotlib plot, based on the keyword arguments passed to it. It first sets the visibility of various components of the axis, such as gridlines and tick lines, based on the "gridOn", "tick1On", "tick2On", "label1On", and "label2On" arguments.

##### Ronan: 

`Calc_label_rot_and_inline()`: Calculate the appropriate label rotation given the linecontour coordinates in screen units, the index of the label location and the label width. The method used here involves computing the path length along the contour in pixel coordinates and then looking approximately (label width / 2) away from central point to determine rotation and then to break contour if desired.

Subplot: adds subplot to a current figure at the specified grid position.  It is similar to the `subplots()` function however unlike `subplots()` it adds one subplot at a time. So to create multiple plots you will need several lines of code with the `subplot()` function.



#### 4. If your programming language uses exceptions: Are they taken into account by the tool? If you think of an exception as another possible branch (to the catch block or the end of the function), how is the CC affected?
Python uses exceptions where the used tool for the cyclomatic complexity analysis, lizard, does take exceptions into account. We think of exceptions as termination operators such as a `return` statement where if-statements and loops where exceptions can potentially be thrown. 

#### 5. Is the documentation of the function clear about the different possible outcomes induced by different branches taken?
The documentation for the different functions are often very clear about the different possible outcomes induced by different branches whereas some functions completely lack documentation. For example, the `hist()` function fully describes its variables and its impact on the histogram whereas the `subsuper()` function completely lack documentation. 

## 3.5 Part 2: Coverage measurement & improvement
#### DIY tool questions:
#### 1. What is the quality of your own coverage measurement? Does it take into account ternary operators (condition ? yes : no) and exceptions, if available in your language?
The results of a boolean list for each of our five functions to a text file when the unit-tests are completed. To set this up we manually instrument the function to include this boolean list and give each branch an index where they set the boolean to true if we ever enter the branch during the tests. 

It does consider ternary operators and exceptions when these boolean assignment instructions have been set in the function. 

#### 2. What are the limitations of your tool? How would the instrumentation change if you modify the program? 
The limitations of the tool are that it is solely up to the developer to manually set these list assignments within the function which could cause it to generate the wrong output and the drawbacks of having to add these list assignments naturally causes lower performance.

Changing the program to how we would like it to work would not require additional code to be inserted into the function and rather directly reading the file which we determined would take too much time for this assignment while the task only required manual instrumentation which is what this tool achieves. 

#### 3. If you have an automated tool, are your results consistent with the ones produced by existing tool(s)?
Yes, the tool was accurate compared to the automated coverage tool where we could see which lines were not executed in an HTML format where the corresponding branches also indicated that they were not taken in our tool.

### 3.5.2 Task 2: Coverage improvement
1,2 Relates more to instructions for the task.
#### 3. Create new test cases as needed to improve branch coverage in the given functions. Can you call the function directly? Can you expand on existing tests? Do you have to add additional interfaces to the system (as public methods) to make it possible to set up test data structures?
The new tests to improve coverage could mostly be done by replicating existing tests and editing them to setup the arguments to reach different branches. Most of the functions require data structures and additional interfaces where a lot of inspiration could be drawn from the existing tests.

#### 4. If you have 100 % branch coverage, you can choose other functions or think about path coverage. You may cover all branches in a function, but what does this mean for the combination of branches? Consider the existing tests by hand and check how they cover the branches (in which combinations).
We changed functions when 100% branch coverage was achieved. Path coverage is the combination of branches taken in a particular function call which can drastically change the execution and the correctness of the output, but we only considered to achieve branch coverage in the tests as that was the requirement for the task.

### 3.5.3 Task 3: Refactoring plan
The high complexity is often necessary in the functions but could definitely be split up in many cases where specific use functionalities within the program could instead be function calls which would aid in creating abstractions but would of course add up to the same complexity number.  
   
This would be done by copying parts of the code for a specific purpose and instead creating a helper function that achieves the same purpose. This is exactly what we done with the group members aiming for P+. We observed what the parts of the code with a high number of branches with a specific purpose did and constructed functions with the correct arguments and return values so as to not change any functionality. 

### P+: Carried out refactoring and improved branch coverage with 4 tests:

```

#### Jonas: 
Refactored the hist() function to decrease the cyclomatic complexity number from 77 to 42 (0.65 * 77 = 50.05 → more than 35% improvement) by taking three large parts with a specific purpose that included many branches and separating them into three different helper functions that reduced the complexity. 

Branch coverage was improved from 81% to 88.9% with four new tests that took inspiration from the previous tests and edited the function arguments and data structures before the function call to reach new branches. 

#### Klara:
Improved branch coverage of streamplot() with 4 new tests. The coverage went from 95% to ?????.

Refactored the streamplot function to reduce the cyclomatic complexity from CNN 30 to 18, a 35% improvement would have resulted in CCN 19.5, meaning the complexity was improved by more than 35%. 

#### Pontus

* Reduced the CCN from 17 -> 10 for the function get_tight_layout_figure() which is about 41% (get_tight_layout_figure@194-301@./_tight_layout.py) 
* and improved branch coverage with 4 new tests for the function table() (table@654-830@./table.py) from 75% -> 89%

#### How have you improved during the course?
We recently changed groups so nothing can really be said about the current group's improvement in working together. 

#### Where is there potential for improvement?
A lot of things can be done to improve where the main improvement probably lies in being able to fully work in parallel which was hindered mainly by the difficulties with building the chosen project for all group members but also communication.


## Overall experience

#### What are your main take-aways from this project? What did you learn?
Our main takeaways from this assignment is mostly grasping the complexity of very large code base. Writing test-cases for functions that you have not written yourself is very time-consuming and complicated, both to first understand the function and to make the test-case execute critical parts of the code.
