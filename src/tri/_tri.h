/*
 * Unstructured triangular grid functions, particularly contouring.
 *
 * There are two main classes: Triangulation and TriContourGenerator.
 *
 * Triangulation
 * -------------
 * Triangulation is an unstructured triangular grid with npoints and ntri
 * triangles.  It consists of point x and y coordinates, and information about
 * the triangulation stored in an integer array of shape (ntri,3) called
 * triangles.  Each triangle is represented by three point indices (in the
 * range 0 to npoints-1) that comprise the triangle, ordered anticlockwise.
 * There is an optional mask of length ntri which can be used to mask out
 * triangles and has the same result as removing those triangles from the
 * 'triangles' array.
 *
 * A particular edge of a triangulation is termed a TriEdge, which is a
 * triangle index and an edge index in the range 0 to 2.  TriEdge(tri,edge)
 * refers to the edge that starts at point index triangles(tri,edge) and ends
 * at point index triangles(tri,(edge+1)%3).
 *
 * Various derived fields are calculated when they are first needed.  The
 * triangle connectivity is stored in a neighbors array of shape (ntri,3) such
 * that neighbors(tri,edge) is the index of the triangle that adjoins the
 * TriEdge(tri,edge), or -1 if there is no such neighbor.
 *
 * A triangulation has one or more boundaries, each of which is a 1D array of
 * the TriEdges that comprise the boundary, in order following the boundary
 * with non-masked triangles on the left.
 *
 * TriContourGenerator
 * -------------------
 * A TriContourGenerator generates contours for a particular Triangulation.
 * The process followed is different for non-filled and filled contours, with
 * one and two contour levels respectively.  In both cases boundary contour
 * lines are found first, then interior lines.
 *
 * Boundary lines start and end on a boundary.  They are found by traversing
 * the triangulation boundary edges until a suitable start point is found, and
 * then the contour line is followed across the interior of the triangulation
 * until it ends on another boundary edge.  For a non-filled contour this
 * completes a line, whereas a filled contour continues by following the
 * boundary around until either another boundary start point is found or the
 * start of the contour line is reached.  Filled contour generation stores
 * boolean flags to indicate which boundary edges have already been traversed
 * so that they are not dealt with twice.  Similar flags are used to indicate
 * which triangles have been used when following interior lines.
 *
 * Interior lines do not intersect any boundaries.  They are found by
 * traversing all triangles that have not yet been visited until a suitable
 * starting point is found, and then the contour line is followed across the
 * interior of the triangulation until it returns to the start point.  For
 * filled contours this process is repeated for both lower and upper contour
 * levels, and the direction of traversal is reversed for upper contours.
 *
 * Working out in which direction a contour line leaves a triangle uses the
 * a lookup table.  A triangle has three points, each of which has a z-value
 * which is either less than the contour level or not.  Hence there are 8
 * configurations to deal with, 2 of which do not have a contour line (all
 * points below or above (including the same as) the contour level) and 6 that
 * do.  See the function get_exit_edge for details.

/* TriFinder class implemented using the trapezoid map algorithm from the book
 * "Computational Geometry, Algorithms and Applications", second edition, by
 * M. de Berg, M. van Kreveld, M. Overmars and O. Schwarzkopf.
 *
 * The domain of interest is composed of vertical-sided trapezoids that are
 * bounded to the left and right by points of the triangulation, and below and
 * above by edges of the triangulation.  Each triangle is represented by 1 or
 * more of these trapezoids.  Edges are inserted one a time in a random order.
 *
 * As the trapezoid map is created, a search tree is also created which allows
 * fast lookup O(log N) of the trapezoid containing the point of interest.
 * There are 3 types of node in the search tree: all leaf nodes represent
 * trapezoids and all branch nodes have 2 child nodes and are either x-nodes or
 * y-nodes.  X-nodes represent points in the triangulation, and their 2 children
 * refer to those parts of the search tree to the left and right of the point.
 * Y-nodes represent edges in the triangulation, and their 2 children refer to
 * those parts of the search tree below and above the edge.
 *
 * Nodes can be repeated throughout the search tree, and each is reference
 * counted through the multiple parent nodes it is a child of.
 *
 * The algorithm is only intended to work with valid triangulations, i.e. it
 * must not contain duplicate points, triangles formed from colinear points, or
 * overlapping triangles.  It does have some tolerance to triangles formed from
 * colinear points but only in the simplest of cases.  No explicit testing of
 * the validity of the triangulation is performed as this is a computationally
