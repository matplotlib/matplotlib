2007-12-25 Changed masked array importing to work with the upcoming
           numpy 1.05 (now the maskedarray branch) as well as with
           earlier versions. - EF

2007-12-16 rec2csv saves doubles without losing precision. Also, it
           does not close filehandles passed in open. - JDH,ADS

2007-12-13 Moved rec2gtk to matplotlib.toolkits.gtktools and rec2excel
           to matplotlib.toolkits.exceltools - JDH

           MGD

2007-12-10 Fix SVG text rendering bug. - MGD

2007-12-10 Increase accuracy of circle and ellipse drawing by using an
           8-piece bezier approximation, rather than a 4-piece one.
           Fix PDF, SVG and Cairo backends so they can draw paths
           (meaning ellipses as well). - MGD

2007-12-07 Issue a warning when drawing an image on a non-linear axis. - MGD

2007-12-06 let widgets.Cursor initialize to the lower x and y bounds
           rather than 0,0, which can cause havoc for dates and other
           transforms - DSD

2007-12-06 updated references to mpl data directories for py2exe - DSD

2007-12-06 fixed a bug in rcsetup, see bug 1845057 - DSD

2007-12-05 Fix how fonts are cached to avoid loading the same one multiple times.

2007-11-27 Released 0.91.1 at revision 4517

===============================================================
2007-11-27 Released 0.91.0 at revision 4478

2007-11-13 All backends now support writing to a file-like object, not
	   just a regular file.  savefig() can be passed a file-like
	   object in place of a file path. - MGD

2007-11-13 Improved the default backend selection at build time:
           SVG -> Agg -> TkAgg -> WXAgg -> GTK -> GTKAgg. The last usable
           backend in this progression will be chosen in the default
           config file. If a backend is defined in setup.cfg, that will
           be the default backend - DSD

2007-11-13 Improved creation of default config files at build time for
           traited config package - DSD

2007-11-12 Exposed all the build options in setup.cfg. These options are
           read into a dict called "options" by setupext.py. Also, added
           "-mpl" tags to the version strings for packages provided by
           matplotlib. Versions provided by mpl will be identified and
           updated on subsequent installs - DSD

2007-11-12 Added support for STIX fonts.  A new rcParam,
	   mathtext.fontset, can be used to choose between:

	   'cm':
	     The TeX/LaTeX Computer Modern fonts

	   'stix':
	     The STIX fonts (see stixfonts.org)

	   'stixsans':
	     The STIX fonts, using sans-serif glyphs by default

	   'custom':
	     A generic Unicode font, in which case the mathtext font
	     must be specified using mathtext.bf, mathtext.it,
	     mathtext.sf etc.

	   Added a new example, stix_fonts_demo.py to show how to access
	   different fonts and unusual symbols.

           - MGD

2007-11-12 Options to disable building backend extension modules moved
           from setup.py to setup.cfg - DSD

2007-11-09 Applied Martin Teichmann's patch 1828813: a QPainter is used in
           paintEvent, which has to be destroyed using  the method end(). If
           matplotlib raises an exception before the call to end - and it
           does if you feed it with bad data - this method end() is never
           called and Qt4 will start spitting error messages

2007-11-09 Moved pyparsing back into matplotlib namespace. Don't use
           system pyparsing, API is too variable from one release
           to the next - DSD

2007-11-08 Made pylab use straight numpy instead of oldnumeric
           by default - EF

2007-11-08 Added additional record array utilites to mlab (rec2excel,
           rec2gtk, rec_join, rec_append_field, rec_drop_field) - JDH

2007-11-08 Updated pytz to version 2007g - DSD

2007-11-08 Updated pyparsing to version 1.4.8 - DSD

2007-11-08 Moved csv2rec to recutils and added other record array
           utilities - JDH

2007-11-08 If available, use existing pyparsing installation - DSD

2007-11-07 Removed old enthought.traits from lib/matplotlib, added
           Gael Varoquaux's enthought.traits-2.6b1, which is stripped
           of setuptools. The package is installed to site-packages
           if not already available - DSD

2007-11-05 Added easy access to minor tick properties; slight mod
           of patch by Pierre G-M - EF

2007-11-02 Commited Phil Thompson's patch 1599876, fixes to Qt4Agg
           backend and qt4 blitting demo - DSD

2007-11-02 Commited Phil Thompson's patch 1599876, fixes to Qt4Agg
           backend and qt4 blitting demo - DSD

2007-10-31 Made log color scale easier to use with contourf;
           automatic level generation now works. - EF

2007-10-24 Added ax kwarg to Figure.colorbar and pyplot.colorbar - EF

2007-10-19 Removed a gsave/grestore pair surrounding _draw_ps, which
           was causing a loss graphics state info (see "EPS output
           problem - scatter & edgecolors" on mpl-dev, 2007-10-29)
           - DSD

2007-10-15 Fixed a bug in patches.Ellipse that was broken for
           aspect='auto'.  Scale free ellipses now work properly for
           equal and auto on Agg and PS, and they fall back on a
           polygonal approximation for nonlinear transformations until
           we convince oursleves that the spline approximation holds
           for nonlinear transformations. Added
           unit/ellipse_compare.py to compare spline with vertex
           approx for both aspects. JDH

2007-10-05 remove generator expressions from texmanager and mpltraits.
           generator expressions are not supported by python-2.3 - DSD

2007-10-01 Made matplotlib.use() raise an exception if called after
           backends has been imported. - EF

2007-09-30 Modified update* methods of Bbox and Interval so they
           work with reversed axes.  Prior to this, trying to
           set the ticks on a reversed axis failed with an
           uninformative error message. - EF

2007-09-30 Applied patches to axes3d to fix index error problem - EF

2007-09-24 Applied Eike Welk's patch reported on mpl-dev on 2007-09-22
           Fixes a bug with multiple plot windows in the qt backend,
           ported the changes to backend_qt4 as well - DSD

2007-09-21 Changed cbook.reversed to yield the same result as the
           python reversed builtin - DSD

2007-09-13 The usetex support in the pdf backend is more usable now,
           so I am enabling it. - JKS

2007-09-12 Fixed a Axes.bar unit bug - JDH

2007-09-10 Made skiprows=1 the default on csv2rec - JDH

2007-09-09 Split out the plotting part of pylab and put it in
           pyplot.py; removed numerix from the remaining pylab.py,
           which imports everything from pyplot.py.  The intention
           is that apart from cleanups, the result of importing
           from pylab is nearly unchanged, but there is the
           new alternative of importing from pyplot to get
           the state-engine graphics without all the numeric
           functions.
           Numpified examples; deleted two that were obsolete;
           modified some to use pyplot. - EF

2007-09-08 Eliminated gd and paint backends - EF

2007-09-06 .bmp file format is now longer an alias for .raw

2007-09-07 Added clip path support to pdf backend. - JKS

2007-09-06 Fixed a bug in the embedding of Type 1 fonts in PDF.
           Now it doesn't crash Preview.app. - JKS

2007-09-06 Refactored image saving code so that all GUI backends can
           save most image types.  See FILETYPES for a matrix of
           backends and their supported file types.
           Backend canvases should no longer write their own print_figure()
           method -- instead they should write a print_xxx method for
           each filetype they can output and add an entry to their
           class-scoped filetypes dictionary. - MGD

2007-09-05 Fixed Qt version reporting in setupext.py - DSD

2007-09-04 Embedding Type 1 fonts in PDF, and thus usetex support
           via dviread, sort of works. To test, enable it by
           renaming _draw_tex to draw_tex. - JKS

2007-09-03 Added ability of errorbar show limits via caret or
           arrowhead ends on the bars; patch by Manual Metz. - EF

2007-09-03 Created type1font.py, added features to AFM and FT2Font
           (see API_CHANGES), started work on embedding Type 1 fonts
           in pdf files. - JKS

2007-09-02 Continued work on dviread.py. - JKS

2007-08-16 Added a set_extent method to AxesImage, allow data extent
           to be modified after initial call to imshow - DSD

2007-08-14 Fixed a bug in pyqt4 subplots-adjust. Thanks to
           Xavier Gnata for the report and suggested fix - DSD

2007-08-13 Use pickle to cache entire fontManager; change to using
            font_manager module-level function findfont wrapper for
            the fontManager.findfont method - EF

2007-08-11 Numpification and cleanup of mlab.py and some examples - EF

2007-08-06 Removed mathtext2

2007-07-31 Refactoring of distutils scripts.
           - Will not fail on the entire build if an optional Python
             package (e.g. Tkinter) is installed but its development
             headers are not (e.g. tk-devel).  Instead, it will
             continue to build all other extensions.
           - Provide an overview at the top of the output to display
             what dependencies and their versions were found, and (by
             extension) what will be built.
           - Use pkg-config, when available, to find freetype2, since
             this was broken on Mac OS-X when using MacPorts in a non-
             standard location.

2007-07-30 Reorganized configuration code to work with traited config
           objects. The new config system is located in the
           matplotlib.config package, but it is disabled by default.
           To enable it, set NEWCONFIG=True in matplotlib.__init__.py.
           The new configuration system will still use the old
           matplotlibrc files by default. To switch to the experimental,
           traited configuration, set USE_TRAITED_CONFIG=True in
           config.__init__.py.

2007-07-29 Changed default pcolor shading to flat; added aliases
           to make collection kwargs agree with setter names, so
           updating works; related minor cleanups.
           Removed quiver_classic, scatter_classic, pcolor_classic. - EF

2007-07-26 Major rewrite of mathtext.py, using the TeX box layout model.

           There is one (known) backward incompatible change.  The
           font commands (\cal, \rm, \it, \tt) now behave as TeX does:
           they are in effect until the next font change command or
           the end of the grouping.  Therefore uses of $\cal{R}$
           should be changed to ${\cal R}$.  Alternatively, you may
           use the new LaTeX-style font commands (\mathcal, \mathrm,
           \mathit, \mathtt) which do affect the following group,
           eg. $\mathcal{R}$.

           Other new features include:

           - Math may be interspersed with non-math text.  Any text
             with an even number of $'s (non-escaped) will be sent to
             the mathtext parser for layout.

           - Sub/superscripts are less likely to accidentally overlap.

           - Support for sub/superscripts in either order, eg. $x^i_j$
             and $x_j^i$ are equivalent.

           - Double sub/superscripts (eg. $x_i_j$) are considered
             ambiguous and raise an exception.  Use braces to disambiguate.

           - $\frac{x}{y}$ can be used for displaying fractions.

           - $\sqrt[3]{x}$ can be used to display the radical symbol
             with a root number and body.

           - $\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)$ may be used to create
             parentheses and other delimiters that automatically
             resize to the height of their contents.

           - Spacing around operators etc. is now generally more like
             TeX.

           - Added support (and fonts) for boldface (\bf) and
             sans-serif (\sf) symbols.

           - Log-like function name shortcuts are supported.  For
             example, $\sin(x)$ may be used instead of ${\rm sin}(x)$

           - Limited use of kerning for the easy case (same font)

           Behind the scenes, the pyparsing.py module used for doing
           the math parsing was updated to the latest stable version
           (1.4.6).  A lot of duplicate code was refactored out of the
           Font classes.

           - MGD

2007-07-19 completed numpification of most trivial cases - NN

2007-07-19 converted non-numpy relicts throughout the code - NN

2007-07-19 replaced the Python code in numerix/ by a minimal wrapper around
           numpy that explicitly mentions all symbols that need to be
           addressed for further numpification - NN

2007-07-18 make usetex respect changes to rcParams. texmanager used to
           only configure itself when it was created, now it
           reconfigures when rcParams are changed. Thank you Alexander
           Schmolck for contributing a patch - DSD

2007-07-17 added validation to setting and changing rcParams - DSD

2007-07-17 bugfix segfault in transforms module. Thanks Ben North for

2007-07-13 Some minor cleanups in _transforms.cpp - ADS

2007-07-13 Removed the rest of the numerix extension code detritus,
           numpified axes.py, and cleaned up the imports in axes.py
           - JDH

2007-07-13 Added legend.loc as configurable option that could in
           future default to 'best'. - NN

           see tracker numbers 1745400, 1745406, 1745408.
           Also made unit/memleak_gui.py more flexible with
           command-line options. - EF

2007-06-30 Split defaultParams into separate file rcdefaults (together with
           validation code). Some heavy refactoring was necessary to do so,
           but the overall behavior should be the same as before. - NN

2007-06-27 Added MPLCONFIGDIR for the default location for mpl data
           and configuration.  useful for some apache installs where
           HOME is not writable.  Tried to clean up the logic in
           _get_config_dir to support non-writable HOME where are
           writable HOME/.matplotlib already exists - JDH

           unconditionally, while norm.autoscale_None changes
           only None-valued vmin, vmax. - EF

2007-03-31 Added a qt-based subplot-adjustment dialog - DSD

2007-03-30 Fixed a bug in backend_qt4, reported on mpl-dev - DSD

2007-03-26 Removed colorbar_classic from figure.py; fixed bug in
           Figure.clf() in which _axobservers was not getting
           cleared.  Modernization and cleanups. - EF

2007-03-26 Refactored some of the units support -- units now live in
           the respective x and y Axis instances.  See also
           API_CHANGES for some alterations to the conversion
           interface.  JDH

2007-03-25 Fix masked array handling in quiver.py for numpy. (Numeric
           and numarray support for masked arrays is broken in other
           ways when using quiver. I didn't pursue that.) - ADS

2007-03-23 Made font_manager.py close opened files. - JKS

2007-03-22 Made imshow default extent match matshow - EF

2007-03-22 Some more niceties for xcorr -- a maxlags option, normed
           now works for xcorr as well as axorr, usevlines is
           supported, and a zero correlation hline is added.  See
           examples/xcorr_demo.py.  Thanks Sameer for the patch.  -
           JDH

2007-03-21 Axes.vlines and Axes.hlines now create and returns a
           LineCollection, not a list of lines.  This is much faster.
           The kwarg signature has changed, so consult the docs.
           Modified Axes.errorbar which uses vlines and hlines.  See
           API_CHANGES; the return signature for these three functions
           is now different

2007-03-20 Refactored units support and added new examples - JDH

2007-03-19 Added Mike's units patch - JDH

2007-03-18 Matshow as an Axes method; test version matshow1() in
           pylab; added 'integer' Boolean kwarg to MaxNLocator
           initializer to force ticks at integer locations. - EF

2007-03-17 Preliminary support for clipping to paths agg - JDH

2007-03-17 Text.set_text() accepts anything convertible with '%s' - EF

2007-03-14 Add masked-array support to hist. - EF

2007-03-03 Change barh to take a kwargs dict and pass it to bar.
           Fixes sf bug #1669506.

2007-03-02 Add rc parameter pdf.inheritcolor, which disables all
           color-setting operations in the pdf backend. The idea is
           that you include the resulting file in another program and
           set the colors (both stroke and fill color) there, so you
           can use the same pdf file for e.g. a paper and a
           presentation and have them in the surrounding color. You
           will probably not want to draw figure and axis frames in
           that case, since they would be filled in the same color. - JKS

2007-02-26 Prevent building _wxagg.so with broken Mac OS X wxPython. - ADS

2007-02-23 Require setuptools for Python 2.3 - ADS

2007-02-22 WXAgg accelerator updates - KM
           WXAgg's C++ accelerator has been fixed to use the correct wxBitmap
           constructor.

           The backend has been updated to use new wxPython functionality to
           provide fast blit() animation without the C++ accelerator.  This
           requires wxPython 2.8 or later.  Previous versions of wxPython can
           use the C++ acclerator or the old pure Python routines.

           setup.py no longer builds the C++ accelerator when wxPython >= 2.8
           is present.

           The blit() method is now faster regardless of which agg/wxPython
           conversion routines are used.

2007-02-21 Applied the PDF backend patch by Nicolas Grilly.
           This impacts several files and directories in matplotlib:

           - Created the directory lib/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/pdfcorefonts,
             holding AFM files for the 14 PDF core fonts. These fonts are
             embedded in every PDF viewing application.

           - setup.py: Added the directory pdfcorefonts to package_data.

           - lib/matplotlib/__init__.py: Added the default parameter
             'pdf.use14corefonts'. When True, the PDF backend uses
             only the 14 PDF core fonts.

           - lib/matplotlib/afm.py: Added some keywords found in
             recent AFM files. Added a little workaround to handle
             Euro symbol.

           - lib/matplotlib/fontmanager.py: Added support for the 14
             PDF core fonts. These fonts have a dedicated cache (file
             pdfcorefont.cache), not the same as for other AFM files
             (file .afmfont.cache). Also cleaned comments to conform
             to CODING_GUIDE.

           - lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py:
             Added support for 14 PDF core fonts.
             Fixed some issues with incorrect character widths and
             encodings (works only for the most common encoding,
             WinAnsiEncoding, defined by the official PDF Reference).
             Removed parameter 'dpi' because it causes alignment issues.

           -JKS (patch by Nicolas Grilly)

2007-02-17 Changed ft2font.get_charmap, and updated all the files where
           get_charmap is mentioned - ES

2007-02-13 Added barcode demo- JDH

2007-02-13 Added binary colormap to cm - JDH

2007-02-13 Added twiny to pylab - JDH

2007-02-12 Moved data files into lib/matplotlib so that setuptools'
           develop mode works. Re-organized the mpl-data layout so
           that this source structure is maintained in the
           installation. (I.e. the 'fonts' and 'images'
           sub-directories are maintained in site-packages.)  Suggest
           removing site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data and
           ~/.matplotlib/ttffont.cache before installing - ADS

2007-02-07 Committed Rob Hetland's patch for qt4: remove
           references to text()/latin1(), plus some improvements
           to the toolbar layout - DSD

===============================================================
2007-02-06 Released 0.90.0 at revision 3003

2007-01-22 Extended the new picker API to text, patches and patch
           collections.  Added support for user customizable pick hit
           testing and attribute tagging of the PickEvent - Details
           and examples in examples/pick_event_demo.py - JDH

2007-01-16 Begun work on a new pick API using the mpl event handling
           frameowrk.  Artists will define their own pick method with
           a configurable epsilon tolerance and return pick attrs.
           All artists that meet the tolerance threshold will fire a
           PickEvent with artist dependent attrs; eg, a Line2D can set
           the indices attribute that shows the indices into the line
           that are within epsilon of the pick point.  See
           examples/pick_event_demo.py.  The implementation of pick
           for the remaining Artists remains to be done, but the core
           infrastructure at the level of event handling is in place
           with a proof-of-concept implementation for Line2D - JDH

2007-01-16 src/_image.cpp: update to use Py_ssize_t (for 64-bit systems).
           Use return value of fread() to prevent warning messages - SC.

2007-01-15 src/_image.cpp: combine buffer_argb32() and buffer_bgra32() into
           a new method color_conv(format) - SC

2007-01-14 backend_cairo.py: update draw_arc() so that
           examples/arctest.py looks correct - SC

2007-01-12 backend_cairo.py: enable clipping. Update draw_image() so that
           examples/contour_demo.py looks correct - SC

2007-01-12 backend_cairo.py: fix draw_image() so that examples/image_demo.py
           now looks correct - SC

2007-01-11 Added Axes.xcorr and Axes.acorr to plot the cross
           correlation of x vs y or the autocorrelation of x.  pylab
           wrappers also provided.  See examples/xcorr_demo.py - JDH

2007-01-10 Added "Subplot.label_outer" method.  It will set the
           visibility of the ticklabels so that yticklabels are only
           visible in the first column and xticklabels are only
           visible in the last row - JDH

2007-01-02 Added additional kwarg documentation - JDH

2006-12-28 Improved error message for nonpositive input to log
           transform; added log kwarg to bar, barh, and hist,
           and modified bar method to behave sensibly by default
           when the ordinate has a log scale.  (This only works
           if the log scale is set before or by the call to bar,
           hence the utility of the log kwarg.) - EF

2006-12-27 backend_cairo.py: update draw_image() and _draw_mathtext() to work
           with numpy - SC

2006-12-20 Fixed xpdf dependency check, which was failing on windows.
           Removed ps2eps dependency check. - DSD

2006-12-19 Added Tim Leslie's spectral patch - JDH

2006-12-17 Added rc param 'axes.formatter.limits' to control
           the default threshold for switching to scientific
           notation. Added convenience method
           Axes.ticklabel_format() for turning scientific notation
           on or off on either or both axes. - EF

2006-12-16 Added ability to turn control scientific notation
           in ScalarFormatter - EF

2006-12-16 Enhanced boxplot to handle more flexible inputs - EF

2006-12-13 Replaced calls to where() in colors.py with much faster
           clip() and putmask() calls; removed inappropriate
           uses of getmaskorNone (which should be needed only
           very rarely); all in response to profiling by
           David Cournapeau.  Also fixed bugs in my 2-D
           array support from 12-09. - EF

2006-12-09 Replaced spy and spy2 with the new spy that combines
           marker and image capabilities - EF

2006-12-09 Added support for plotting 2-D arrays with plot:
           columns are plotted as in Matlab - EF

2006-12-09 Added linewidth kwarg to bar and barh; fixed arg
           checking bugs - EF

2006-12-07 Made pcolormesh argument handling match pcolor;
           fixed kwarg handling problem noted by Pierre GM - EF

2006-12-06 Made pcolor support vector X and/or Y instead of
           requiring 2-D arrays - EF

2006-12-05 Made the default Artist._transform None (rather than
           invoking identity_transform for each artist only to have it
           overridden later).  Use artist.get_transform() rather than
           artist._transform, even in derived classes, so that the
           default transform will be created lazily as needed - JDH

2006-12-03 Added LogNorm to colors.py as illustrated by
           examples/pcolor_log.py, based on suggestion by
           Jim McDonald.  Colorbar modified to handle LogNorm.
           Norms have additional "inverse" method. - EF

2006-12-02 Changed class names in colors.py to match convention:
           normalize -> Normalize, no_norm -> NoNorm.  Old names
           are still available.
           Changed __init__.py rc defaults to match those in
           matplotlibrc - EF

2006-11-22 Fixed bug in set_*lim that I had introduced on 11-15 - EF

2006-11-22 Added examples/clippedline.py, which shows how to clip line
           data based on view limits -- it also changes the marker
           style when zoomed in - JDH

2006-11-21 Some spy bug-fixes and added precision arg per Robert C's
           suggestion  - JDH

2006-11-19 Added semi-automatic docstring generation detailing all the
           kwargs that functions take using the artist introspection
           tools; eg 'help text now details the scatter kwargs
           that control the Text properties  - JDH

2006-11-17 Removed obsolete scatter_classic, leaving a stub to
           raise NotImplementedError; same for pcolor_classic - EF

2006-11-15 Removed obsolete pcolor_classic - EF

2006-11-15 Fixed 1588908 reported by Russel Owen; factored
           nonsingular method out of ticker.py, put it into
           transforms.py as a function, and used it in
           set_xlim and set_ylim. - EF

2006-11-14 Applied patch 1591716 by Ulf Larssen to fix a bug in
           apply_aspect.  Modified and applied patch
           1594894 by mdehoon to fix bugs and improve
           formatting in lines.py. Applied patch 1573008
           by Greg Willden to make psd etc. plot full frequency
           range for complex inputs. - EF

2006-11-14 Improved the ability of the colorbar to track
           changes in corresponding image, pcolor, or
           contourf. - EF

2006-11-11 Fixed bug that broke Numeric compatibility;
           added support for alpha to colorbar.  The
           alpha information is taken from the mappable
           object, not specified as a kwarg. - EF

2006-11-05 Added broken_barh function for makring a sequence of
           horizontal bars broken by gaps -- see examples/broken_barh.py

2006-11-05 Removed lineprops and markerprops from the Annotation code
           and replaced them with an arrow configurable with kwarg
           arrowprops.  See examples/annotation_demo.py - JDH

2006-11-02 Fixed a pylab subplot bug that was causing axes to be
           deleted with hspace or wspace equals zero in
           subplots_adjust - JDH

2006-10-31 Applied axes3d patch 1587359
           http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1587359&group_id=80706&atid=560722

2006-10-25 Made "tiny" kwarg in Locator.nonsingular much smaller - EF

2006-10-17 Closed sf bug 1562496 update line props dash/solid/cap/join
           styles - JDH

2006-10-17 Complete overhaul of the annotations API and example code -
           See matplotlib.text.Annotation and
           examples/annotation_demo.py JDH

2006-10-12 Committed Manuel Metz's StarPolygon code and
           examples/scatter_star_poly.py - JDH


2006-10-11 commented out all default values in matplotlibrc.template
           Default values should generally be taken from defaultParam in
           __init__.py - the file matplotlib should only contain those values
           that the user wants to explicitly change from the default.
           (see thread "marker color handling" on matplotlib-devel)

2006-10-10 Changed default comment character for load to '#' - JDH

2006-10-10 deactivated rcfile-configurability of markerfacecolor
           and markeredgecolor. Both are now hardcoded to the special value
           'auto' to follow the line color. Configurability at run-time
           (using function arguments) remains functional. - NN

2006-10-07 introduced dummy argument magnification=1.0 to
           FigImage.make_image to satisfy unit test figimage_demo.py
           The argument is not yet handled correctly, which should only
           show up when using non-standard DPI settings in PS backend,
           introduced by patch #1562394. - NN

2006-10-06 add backend-agnostic example: simple3d.py - NN

2006-09-29 fix line-breaking for SVG-inline images (purely cosmetic) - NN

2006-09-29 reworked set_linestyle and set_marker
           markeredgecolor and markerfacecolor now default to
           a special value "auto" that keeps the color in sync with
           the line color
           further, the intelligence of axes.plot is cleaned up,
           improved and simplified. Complete compatibility cannot be
           guaranteed, but the new behavior should be much more predictable
           (see patch #1104615 for details) - NN

2006-09-29 changed implementation of clip-path in SVG to work around a
           limitation in inkscape - NN

2006-09-29 added two options to matplotlibrc:
           svg.image_inline
           svg.image_noscale
           see patch #1533010 for details - NN

2006-09-29 axes.py: cleaned up kwargs checking - NN

2006-09-29 setup.py: cleaned up setup logic - NN

2006-09-29 setup.py: check for required pygtk versions, fixes bug #1460783 - SC

===============================================================
2006-09-27 Released 0.87.6 at revision 2783

2006-09-24 Added line pointers to the Annotation code, and a pylab
           interface.  See matplotlib.text.Annotation,
           examples/annotation_demo.py and
           examples/annotation_demo_pylab.py - JDH

2006-09-18 mathtext2.py: The SVG backend now supports the same things that
           the AGG backend does. Fixed some bugs with rendering, and out of
           bounds errors in the AGG backend - ES. Changed the return values
           of math_parse_s_ft2font_svg to support lines (fractions etc.)

2006-09-17 Added an Annotation class to facilitate annotating objects
           and an examples file examples/annotation_demo.py.  I want
           to add dash support as in TextWithDash, but haven't decided
           yet whether inheriting from TextWithDash is the right base
           class or if another approach is needed - JDH

===============================================================
2006-09-05 Released 0.87.5 at revision 2761

2006-09-04 Added nxutils for some numeric add-on extension code --
                   specifically a better/more efficient inside polygon tester (see

2006-09-04 Made bitstream fonts the rc default - JDH

2006-08-31 Fixed alpha-handling bug in ColorConverter, affecting
           collections in general and contour/contourf in
           particular. - EF

2006-08-30 ft2font.cpp: Added draw_rect_filled method (now used by mathtext2
           to draw the fraction bar) to FT2Font - ES

2006-08-29 setupext.py: wrap calls to tk.getvar() with str(). On some
           systems, getvar returns a Tcl_Obj instead of a string - DSD

2006-08-28 mathtext2.py: Sub/superscripts can now be complex (i.e.
           fractions etc.). The demo is also updated - ES

2006-08-28 font_manager.py: Added /usr/local/share/fonts to list of
           X11 font directories - DSD

2006-08-28 mahtext2.py: Initial support for complex fractions. Also,
           rendering is now completely separated from parsing. The
           sub/superscripts now work better.
           Updated the mathtext2_demo.py - ES

2006-08-27 qt backends: don't create a QApplication when backend is
           imported, do it when the FigureCanvasQt is created. Simplifies
           applications where mpl is embedded in qt. Updated
           embedding_in_qt* examples - DSD

2006-08-27 mahtext2.py: Now the fonts are searched in the OS font dir and
           in the mpl-data dir. Also env is not a dict anymore. - ES

2006-08-26 minor changes to __init__.py, mathtex2_demo.py. Added matplotlibrc
           key "mathtext.mathtext2" (removed the key "mathtext2") - ES

2006-08-21 mathtext2.py: Initial support for fractions
           Updated the mathtext2_demo.py
           _mathtext_data.py: removed "\" from the unicode dicts
           mathtext.py: Minor modification (because of _mathtext_data.py)- ES

2006-08-20 Added mathtext2.py: Replacement for mathtext.py. Supports _ ^,
           \rm, \cal etc., \sin, \cos etc., unicode, recursive nestings,
           inline math mode. The only backend currently supported is Agg
           __init__.py: added new rc params for mathtext2
           added mathtext2_demo.py example - ES

2006-08-19 Added embedding_in_qt4.py example - DSD

2006-08-11 Added scale free Ellipse patch for Agg - CM

2006-07-31 Don't let postscript's xpdf distiller compress images - DSD

2006-07-31 Added shallowcopy() methods to all Transformations;
           removed copy_bbox_transform and copy_bbox_transform_shallow
           from transforms.py;

2006-07-07 Fixed a usetex bug with older versions of latex - DSD

2006-07-07 Add compatibility for NumPy 1.0 - TEO

2006-06-29 Added a Qt4Agg backend. Thank you James Amundson - DSD

2006-06-26 Fixed a usetex bug. On windows, usetex will prcess
           postscript output in the current directory rather than
           in a temp directory. This is due to the use of spaces
           and tildes in windows paths, which cause problems with
           latex. The subprocess module is no longer used. - DSD

2006-06-22 Various changes to bar(), barh(), and hist().
           Added 'edgecolor' keyword arg to bar() and barh().
           The x and y args in barh() have been renamed to width
           and bottom respectively, and their order has been swapped
           to maintain a (position, value) order ala matlab. left,
           height, width and bottom args can now all be scalars or
           sequences. barh() now defaults to edge alignment instead
           of center alignment. Added a keyword arg 'align' to bar(),
           barh() and hist() that controls between edge or center bar
           alignment. Fixed ignoring the rcParams['patch.facecolor']
           for bar color in bar() and barh(). Fixed ignoring the
           rcParams['lines.color'] for error bar color in bar()
           and barh(). Fixed a bug where patches would be cleared
           when error bars were plotted if rcParams['axes.hold']
           was False. - MAS

2006-06-22 Added support for numerix 2-D arrays as alternatives to
           a sequence of (x,y) tuples for specifying paths in
           collections, quiver, contour, pcolor, transforms.
           Fixed contour bug involving setting limits for
           color mapping.  Added numpy-style all() to numerix. - EF

2006-06-20 Added custom FigureClass hook to pylab interface - see
           examples/custom_figure_class.py

2006-06-16 Added colormaps from gist (gist_earth, gist_stern,
           gist_rainbow, gist_gray, gist_yarg, gist_heat, gist_ncar) - JW

2006-06-16 Added a pointer to parent in figure canvas so you can
           access the container with fig.canvas.manager.  Useful if
           you want to set the window title, eg in gtk
           fig.canvas.manager.window.set_title, though a GUI neutral
           method would be preferable JDH

2006-06-16 Fixed colorbar.py to handle indexed colors (i.e.,
           norm = no_norm()) by centering each colored region
           on its index. - EF

2006-06-15 Added scalex and scaley to Axes.autoscale_view to support
           selective autoscaling just the x or y axis, and supported
           these command in plot so you can say plot(something,
           scaley=False) and just the x axis will be autoscaled.
           Modified axvline and axhline to support this, so for
           example axvline will no longer autoscale the y axis. JDH

2006-06-11 Added quiverkey command to pylab and Axes, using
           QuiverKey class in quiver.py.  Changed pylab and Axes
           to use quiver2 if possible, but drop back to the
           newly-renamed quiver_classic if necessary.  Modified
           examples/quiver_demo.py to illustrate the new quiver
           and quiverkey.  Changed LineCollection implementation
           slightly to improve compatibility with PolyCollection. - EF

2006-06-11 Fixed a usetex bug for windows, running latex on files
           with spaces in their names or paths was failing - DSD

2006-06-09 Made additions to numerix, changes to quiver to make it
           work with all numeric flavors. - EF

2006-06-09 Added quiver2 function to pylab and method to axes,
           with implementation via a Quiver class in quiver.py.
           quiver2 will replace quiver before the next release;
           it is placed alongside it initially to facilitate
           testing and transition. See also
           examples/quiver2_demo.py. - EF

           augmented to accept and display offset text. - EF

2006-05-14 New colorbar; old one is renamed to colorbar_classic.
           New colorbar code is in colorbar.py, with wrappers in
           figure.py and pylab.py.
           Fixed aspect-handling bug reported by Michael Mossey.
           Made backend_bases.draw_quad_mesh() run.- EF

2006-05-08 Changed handling of end ranges in contourf: replaced

2006-04-16 Masked array support for pcolormesh; made pcolormesh support the
           same combinations of X,Y,C dimensions as pcolor does;
           improved (I hope) description of grid used in pcolor,
           pcolormesh. - EF

2006-04-14 Reorganized axes.py - EF

2006-04-13 Fixed a bug Ryan found using usetex with sans-serif fonts and
           exponential tick labels - DSD

2006-04-11 Refactored backend_ps and backend_agg to prevent module-level
           texmanager imports. Now these imports only occur if text.usetex
           rc setting is true - DSD

2006-04-10 Committed changes required for building mpl on win32
           platforms with visual studio.  This allows wxpython

2006-04-05 Added support for the new API in the postscript backend.
           Allows values to be masked using nan's, and faster file
           creation - DSD

2006-04-05 Use python's subprocess module for usetex calls to
           external programs. subprocess catches when they exit
           abnormally so an error can be raised. - DSD

2006-04-03 Fixed the bug in which widgets would not respond to
           events.  This regressed the twinx functionality, so I
           also updated subplots_adjust to update axes that share
           an x or y with a subplot instance. - CM

2006-04-02 Moved PBox class to transforms and deleted pbox.py;
           made pylab axis command a thin wrapper for Axes.axis;
           more tweaks to aspect-ratio handling; fixed Axes.specgram

2006-03-15 Fixed bug in MaxNLocator revealed by daigos@infinito.it.
           The main change is that Locator.nonsingular now adjusts
           vmin and vmax if they are nearly the same, not just if

2006-1-11 Fixed setup.py for win32 build and added rc template to the MANIFEST.in

2006-1-10 Added xpdf distiller option. matplotlibrc ps.usedistiller can now be
            none, false, ghostscript, or xpdf. Validation checks for
            dependencies. This needs testing, but the xpdf option should produce
            the highest-quality output and small file sizes - DSD

2006-01-10 For the usetex option, backend_ps now does all the LaTeX work in the
            os's temp directory - DSD

2006-1-10 Added checks for usetex dependencies. - DSD

=======================================================================
2006-1-9 Released 0.86

           JDH

2005-12-12 Updated pyparsing and mathtext for some speed enhancements
           (Thanks Paul McGuire) and minor fixes to scipy numerix and
           setuptools

2005-12-12 Matplotlib data is now installed as package_data in
           the matplotlib module.  This gets rid of checking the
           many possibilities in matplotlib._get_data_path() - CM

2005-12-11 Support for setuptools/pkg_resources to build and use
           matplotlib as an egg. Still allows matplotlib to exist
           using a traditional distutils install. - ADS

2005-12-03 Modified setup to build matplotlibrc based on compile time
           findings.  It will set numerix in the order of scipy,
           numarray, Numeric depending on which are founds, and
           backend as in preference order GTKAgg, WXAgg, TkAgg, GTK,
           Agg, PS

2005-12-03 Modified scipy patch to support Numeric, scipy and numarray
           Some work remains to be done because some of the scipy
           imports are broken if only the core is installed.  Eg
           apparently we need from scipy.basic.fftpack import * rather
           than from scipy.fftpack import *

2005-11-28 Got TkAgg blitting working 100% (cross fingers) correctly. - CM

2005-11-27 Multiple changes in cm.py, colors.py, figure.py, image.py,
           contour.py, contour_demo.py; new _cm.py, examples/image_masked.py.
           1) Separated the color table data from cm.py out into
           a new file, _cm.py, to make it easier to find the actual
           code in cm.py and to add new colormaps.  Also added
           some line breaks to the color data dictionaries. Everything
           from _cm.py is imported by cm.py, so the split should be
           transparent.
           2) Enabled automatic generation of a colormap from
           a list of colors in contour; see modified
           examples/contour_demo.py.
           3) Support for imshow of a masked array, with the
           ability to specify colors (or no color at all) for
           masked regions, and for regions that are above or
           below the normally mapped region.  See
           examples/image_masked.py.
           4) In support of the above, added two new classes,
           ListedColormap, and no_norm, to colors.py, and modified
           the Colormap class to include common functionality. Added
           a clip kwarg to the normalize class.  Reworked color
           handling in contour.py, especially in the ContourLabeller
           mixin.
           - EF

2005-11-25 Changed text.py to ensure color is hashable. EF

2005-11-16 Added a maxdict item to cbook to prevent caches from
           growing w/o bounds

           added keyword arg (clip_ends) to contourf.
           Colorbar modified to work with new ContourSet object;
           if the ContourSet has lines rather than polygons, the
           colorbar will follow suit. Fixed a bug introduced in
           0.84, in which contourf(...,colors=...) was broken - EF

2005-08-29 Committed Ken's wx blit patch #1275002

2005-08-26 colorbar modifications - now uses contourf instead of imshow
           so that colors used by contourf are displayed correctly.
           Added two new keyword args (cspacing and clabels) that are
           only relevant for ContourMappable images - JSWHIT

2005-08-24 Fixed a PS image bug reported by Darren - JDH

           for the patch) - SC

=======================================================================

2005-07-29 Released 0.83.2

           usual way - SC

2005-07-26 Added new widgets Cursor and HorizontalSpanSelector to
           matplotlib.widgets.  See examples/widgets/cursor.py and
           examples/widgets/span_selector.py - JDH

2005-07-26 added draw event to mpl event hierarchy -- triggered on
           figure.draw

2005-07-26 backend_gtk.py: allow 'f' key to toggle window fullscreen mode

2005-07-26 backend_svg.py: write "<.../>" elements all on one line and remove
           surplus spaces - SC

2005-07-25 backend_svg.py: simplify code by deleting GraphicsContextSVG and
           RendererSVG.new_gc(), and moving the gc.get_capstyle() code into
           RendererSVG._get_gc_props_svg() - SC

2005-07-24 backend_gtk.py: call FigureCanvasBase.motion_notify_event() on
           all motion-notify-events, not just ones where a modifier key or
           button has been pressed (fixes bug report from Niklas Volbers) - SC

2005-07-24 backend_gtk.py: modify print_figure() use own pixmap, fixing
           problems where print_figure() overwrites the display pixmap.

           matplotlib/__init__.py: delete 'FROZEN' and 'McPLError' which are
           no longer used - SC

2005-07-22 backend_gdk.py: removed pygtk.require() - SC

2005-07-21 backend_svg.py: Remove unused imports. Remove methods doc strings

2005-07-07 Added Eric's MA set_xdata Line2D fix - JDH

2005-07-06 Made HOME/.matplotlib the new config dir where the
           matplotlibrc file, the ttf.cache, and the tex.cache live.
           The new default filenames in .matplotlib have no leading
           dot and are not hidden.  Eg, the new names are matplotlibrc
           tex.cache ttffont.cache.  This is how ipython does it so it
           must be right.  If old files are found, a warning is issued
           and they are moved to the new location.  Also fixed
           texmanager to put all files, including temp files in
           ~/.matplotlib/tex.cache, which allows you to usetex in
           non-writable dirs.

2005-07-05 Fixed bug #1231611 in subplots adjust layout.  The problem
           was that the text cacheing mechanism was not using the
           transformation affine in the key. - JDH

2005-07-05 Fixed default backend import problem when using API (SF bug
           # 1209354 -  see API_CHANGES for more info - JDH

2005-07-04 backend_gtk.py: require PyGTK version 2.0.0 or higher - SC

2005-06-30 setupext.py: added numarray_inc_dirs for building against
           numarray when not installed in standard location - ADS

2005-06-27 backend_svg.py: write figure width, height as int, not float.
           Update to fix some of the pychecker warnings - SC

2005-06-23 Updated examples/agg_test.py to demonstrate curved paths
           and fills - JDH

2005-06-21 Moved some texmanager and backend_agg tex caching to class
           level rather than instance level - JDH

2005-06-20 setupext.py: fix problem where _nc_backend_gdk is installed to the
           wrong directory - SC

2005-06-19 Added 10.4 support for CocoaAgg. - CM

2005-06-18 Move Figure.get_width_height() to FigureCanvasBase and return
           int instead of float. - SC

2005-06-18 Applied Ted Drain's QtAgg patch: 1) Changed the toolbar to
           be a horizontal bar of push buttons instead of a QToolbar
           and updated the layout algorithms in the main window
           accordingly.  This eliminates the ability to drag and drop
           the toolbar and detach it from the window.  2) Updated the
           resize algorithm in the main window to show the correct
           size for the plot widget as requested.  This works almost
           correctly right now.  It looks to me like the final size of
           the widget is off by the border of the main window but I
           haven't figured out a way to get that information yet.  We
           could just add a small margin to the new size but that
           seems a little hacky.  3) Changed the x/y location label to
           be in the toolbar like the Tk backend instead of as a
           status line at the bottom of the widget.  4) Changed the
           toolbar pixmaps to use the ppm files instead of the png
           files.  I noticed that the Tk backend buttons looked much
           nicer and it uses the ppm files so I switched them.

2005-06-17 Modified the gtk backend to not queue mouse motion events.
           This allows for live updates when dragging a slider. - CM

2005-06-17 Added starter CocoaAgg backend.  Only works on OS 10.3 for
           now and requires PyObjC.  (10.4 is high priority) - CM

2005-06-17 Upgraded pyparsing and applied Paul McGuire's suggestions
           for speeding things up.  This more than doubles the speed
           of mathtext in my simple tests. JDH

2005-06-16 Applied David Cooke's subplot make_key patch

========================================================

2005-06-15 0.82 released

2005-06-15 Added subplot config tool to GTK* backends -- note you must
           now import the NavigationToolbar2 from your backend of
           choice rather than from backend_gtk because it needs to
           know about the backend specific canvas -- see
           examples/embedding_in_gtk2.py.  Ditto for wx backend -- see
           examples/embedding_in_wxagg.py

2005-06-15 backend_cairo.py: updated to use pycairo 0.5.0 - SC

2005-06-14 Wrote some GUI neutral widgets (Button, Slider,
           RadioButtons, CheckButtons) in matplotlib.widgets.  See
           examples/widgets/*.py - JDH

2005-06-14 Exposed subplot parameters as rc vars and as the fig
           SubplotParams instance subplotpars.  See
           figure.SubplotParams, figure.Figure.subplots_adjust and the
           pylab method subplots_adjust and
           examples/subplots_adjust.py .  Also added a GUI neutral
           widget for adjusting subplots, see
           examples/subplot_toolbar.py - JDH

2005-06-13 Exposed cap and join style for lines with new rc params and
           line properties

        lines.dash_joinstyle : miter        # miter|round|bevel
        lines.dash_capstyle : butt          # butt|round|projecting
        lines.solid_joinstyle : miter       # miter|round|bevel
        lines.solid_capstyle : projecting   # butt|round|projecting

=====================================================================

2005-06-07 matplotlib-0.81 released

2005-06-06 Added autoscale_on prop to axes

2005-06-06 Added Nick's picker "among" patch - JDH

2005-06-05 Fixed a TeX/LaTeX font discrepency in backend_ps. - DSD

2005-06-05 Added a ps.distill option in rc settings. If True, postscript
           output will be distilled using ghostscript, which should trim
           the file size and allow it to load more quickly. Hopefully this
           will address the issue of large ps files due to font
           definitions. Tested with gnu-ghostscript-8.16. - DSD

2005-06-03 Improved support for tex handling of text in backend_ps. - DSD

2005-06-03 Added rc options to render text with tex or latex, and to select
           the latex font package. - DSD

2005-06-03 Fixed a bug in ticker.py causing a ZeroDivisionError

2005-06-02 backend_gtk.py remove DBL_BUFFER, add line to expose_event to
           try to fix pygtk 2.6 redraw problem - SC

2005-06-01 The default behavior of ScalarFormatter now renders scientific
           notation and large numerical offsets in a label at the end of
           the axis. - DSD

2005-06-01 Added Nicholas' frombyte image patch - JDH

2005-05-31 Added vertical TeX support for agg - JDH

2005-05-31 Applied Eric's cntr patch - JDH

2005-05-27 Finally found the pesky agg bug (which Maxim was kind
           enough to fix within hours) that was causing a segfault in
           the win32 cached marker drawing.  Now windows users can get
           the enormouse performance benefits of caced markers w/o
           those occasional pesy screenshots. - JDH

2005-05-27 Got win32 build system working again, using a more recent
           version of gtk and pygtk in the win32 build, gtk 2.6 from
           http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html (you
           will also need libpng12.dll to use these).  I haven't
           tested whether this binary build of mpl for win32 will work
           with older gtk runtimes, so you may need to upgrade.

2005-05-27 Fixed bug where 2nd wxapp could be started if using wxagg
           backend. - ADS

2005-05-26 Added Daishi text with dash patch -- see examples/dashtick.py

2005-05-26 Moved backend_latex functionality into backend_ps. If
           text.usetex=True, the PostScript backend will use LaTeX to
           generate the .ps or .eps file. Ghostscript is required for
           eps output. - DSD

2005-05-24 Fixed alignment and color issues in latex backend. - DSD

2005-05-21 Fixed raster problem for small rasters with dvipng -- looks
           like it was a premultipled alpha problem - JDH

2005-05-20 Added linewidth and faceted kwarg to scatter to control
           edgewidth and color.  Also added autolegend patch to
           inspect line segments.

2005-05-18 Added Orsay and JPL qt fixes - JDH

2005-05-17 Added a psfrag latex backend -- some alignment issues need
           to be worked out. Run with -dLaTeX and a *.tex file and
           *.eps file are generated.  latex and dvips the generated
           latex file to get ps output.  Note xdvi *does* not work,
           you must generate ps.- JDH

2005-05-13 Added Florent Rougon's Axis set_label1
           patch

2005-05-17 pcolor optimization, fixed bug in previous pcolor patch - JSWHIT

2005-05-16 Added support for masked arrays in pcolor - JSWHIT


2005-05-12 Started work on TeX text for antigrain using pngdvi -- see
           examples/tex_demo.py and the new module
           matplotlib.texmanager.  Rotated text not supported and
           rendering small glyps is not working right yet.  BUt large
           fontsizes and/or high dpi saved figs work great.

2005-05-10 New image resize options interpolation options.  New values
           for the interp kwarg are

           'nearest', 'bilinear', 'bicubic', 'spline16', 'spline36',
           'hanning', 'hamming', 'hermite', 'kaiser', 'quadric',
           'catrom', 'gaussian', 'bessel', 'mitchell', 'sinc',
           'lanczos', 'blackman'

           See help(imshow) for details, particularly the
           interpolation, filternorm and filterrad kwargs


2005-05-10 Applied Eric's contour mem leak fixes - JDH

2005-05-10 Extended python agg wrapper and started implementing
           backend_agg2, an agg renderer based on the python wrapper.
           This will be more flexible and easier to extend than the
           current backend_agg.  See also examples/agg_test.py - JDH

2005-05-09 Added Marcin's no legend patch to exclude lines from the
           autolegend builder

           plot(x, y, label='nolegend')

2005-05-05 Upgraded to agg23

2005-05-05 Added newscalarformatter_demo.py to examples. -DSD

2005-05-04 Added NewScalarFormatter. Improved formatting of ticklabels,
           scientific notation, and the ability to plot large large
           numbers with small ranges, by determining a numerical offset.
           See ticker.NewScalarFormatter for more details. -DSD

2005-05-03 Added the option to specify a delimiter in pylab.load -DSD

2005-04-28 Added Darren's line collection example

2005-04-28 Fixed aa property in agg - JDH

2005-04-27 Set postscript page size in .matplotlibrc - DSD

2005-04-26 Added embedding in qt example. - JDH

2005-04-14 Applied Michael Brady's qt backend patch: 1) fix a bug
           where keyboard input was grabbed by the figure and not
           released  2) turn on cursor changes  3) clean up a typo
           and commented-out print statement. - JDH


2005-04-14 Applied Eric Firing's masked data lines patch and contour
           patch.  Support for masked arrays has been added to the
           plot command and to the Line2D object.  Only the valid
           points are plotted.  A "valid_only" kwarg was added to the
           get_xdata() and get_ydata() methods of Line2D; by default
           it is False, so that the original data arrays are
           returned. Setting it to True returns the plottable points.
           - see examples/masked_demo.py - JDH

2005-04-13 Applied Tim Leslie's arrow key event handling patch - JDH


=================================================================
0.80 released

2005-04-11 Applied a variant of rick's xlim/ylim/axis patch.  These
           functions now take kwargs to let you selectively alter only
           the min or max if desired.  Eg xlim(xmin=2) or
           axis(ymax=3).  They always return the new lim. - JDH


2005-04-11 Incorporated Werner's wx patch -- wx backend should be
           compatible with wxpython2.4 and recent versions of 2.5.
           Some early versions of wxpython 2.5 will not work because
           there was a temporary change in the dc API that was rolled
           back to make it 2.4 compliant

2005-04-11 modified tkagg show so that new figure window pops up on
           call to figure

2005-04-11 fixed wxapp init bug

2005-04-02 updated backend_ps.draw_lines, draw_markers for use with the

2005-03-28 Added Jarrod's svg patch for text - JDH

2005-03-28 Added Ludal's arrow and quiver patch - JDH

2005-03-28 Added label kwarg to Axes to facilitate forcing the
           creation of new Axes with otherwise identical attributes

2005-03-28 Applied boxplot and OSX font search patches

2005-03-27 Added ft2font NULL check to fix Japanase font bug - JDH

2005-03-27 Added sprint legend patch plus John Gill's tests and fix --
           see examples/legend_auto.py  - JDH

==========================================================================

2005-03-19 0.73.1 released

2005-03-19 Reverted wxapp handling because it crashed win32 - JDH

2005-03-18 Add .number attribute to figure objects returned by figure() - FP

2005-03-16 Applied Darren's ticker fix for small ranges - JDH

2005-03-16 Fixed tick on horiz colorbar - JDH

2005-03-16 Added Japanses winreg patch - JDH

2005-03-15 backend_gtkagg.py: changed to use double buffering, this fixes
           the problem reported Joachim Berdal Haga - "Parts of plot lagging
       from previous frame in animation". Tested with anim.py and it makes
           no noticable difference to performance (23.7 before, 23.6 after)
       - SC

2005-03-14 add src/_backend_gdk.c extension to provide a substitute function
       for pixbuf.get_pixels_array(). Currently pixbuf.get_pixels_array()
           only works with Numeric, and then only works if pygtk has been
       compiled with Numeric support. The change provides a function
       pixbuf_get_pixels_array() which works with Numeric and numarray and
       is always available. It means that backend_gtk should be able to
       display images and mathtext in all circumstances. - SC

2005-03-11 Upgraded CXX to 5.3.1

2005-03-10 remove GraphicsContextPS.set_linestyle()
       and GraphicsContextSVG.set_linestyle() since they do no more than
           the base class GraphicsContext.set_linestyle() - SC

2005-03-09 Refactored contour functionality into dedicated module

2005-03-09 Added Eric's contourf updates and Nadia's clabel functionality

2005-03-09 Moved colorbar to figure.Figure to expose it for API developers
          - JDH

2005-03-09 backend_cairo.py: implemented draw_markers() - SC

2005-03-09 cbook.py: only use enumerate() (the python version) if the builtin
       version is not available.
           Add new function 'izip' which is set to itertools.izip if available
           and the python equivalent if not available. - SC

2005-03-07 backend_gdk.py: remove PIXELS_PER_INCH from points_to_pixels(), but
       still use it to adjust font sizes. This allows the GTK version of
           line_styles.py to more closely match GTKAgg, previously the markers
           were being drawn too large. - SC

2005-03-01 Added Eric's contourf routines

2005-03-01 Added start of proper agg SWIG wrapper.  I would like to
           expose agg functionality directly a the user level and this
           module will serve that purpose eventually, and will
           hopefully take over most of the functionality of the
           current _image and _backend_agg modules.  - JDH

2005-02-28 Fixed polyfit / polyval to convert input args to float
           arrays - JDH


2005-02-25 Add experimental feature to backend_gtk.py to enable/disable
           double buffering (DBL_BUFFER=True/False) - SC

2005-02-24 colors.py change ColorConverter.to_rgb() so it always returns rgb
           (and not rgba), allow cnames keys to be cached, change the exception
           raised from RuntimeError to ValueError (like hex2color())
       hex2color() use a regular expression to check the color string is
           valid  - SC


2005-02-23 Added rc param ps.useafm so backend ps can use native afm
           fonts or truetype.  afme breaks mathtext but causes much
           smaller font sizes and may result in images that display
           better in some contexts (eg pdfs incorporated into latex
           docs viewed in acrobat reader).  I would like to extend
           this approach to allow the user to use truetype only for
           mathtext, which should be easy.

2005-02-23 Used sequence protocol rather than tuple in agg collection
           drawing routines for greater flexibility - JDH


===========================================================
2005-02-22 0.72.1 released

2005-02-21 fixed linestyles for collections -- contour now dashes for
           levels <0

2005-02-21 fixed ps color bug - JDH

2005-02-15 fixed missing qt file

2005-02-15 banished error_msg and report_error.  Internal backend
           methods like error_msg_gtk are preserved.  backend writers,
           check your backends, and diff against 0.72 to make sure I
           did the right thing! - JDH

2005-02-09 subplot now deletes axes that it overlaps

2005-02-08 Added transparent support for gzipped files in load/save - Fernando
           Perez (FP from now on).

2005-02-08 Small optimizations in PS backend.  They may have a big impact for
           large plots, otherwise they don't hurt  - FP

2005-02-08 Added transparent support for gzipped files in load/save - Fernando
           Perez (FP from now on).

           in agg currently - JDH

2005-02-05 Some superscript text optimizations for ticking log plots

2005-02-05 Added some default key press events to pylab figures: 'g'
           toggles grid - JDH

2005-02-05 Added some support for handling log switching for lines
           that have nonpos data - JDH

           compatible syntax; this also fixed an unequal sized contour
           array bug- JDH

2005-02-04 Modified GTK backends to allow the FigureCanvas to be resized
       smaller than its original size - SC

           - JDH

2005-01-31 updated datalim in contour - JDH

2005-01-30 Added backend_qtagg.py provided by Sigve Tjora - SC

2005-01-28 Added tk.inspect rc param to .matplotlibrc.  IDLE users
           should set tk.pythoninspect:True and interactive:True and
           backend:TkAgg

2005-01-28 Replaced examples/interactive.py with an updated script from
           Fernando Perez - SC

           region=1 seems t fix a lot of the zigzag strangeness.
           Added colormaps as default for contour - JDH

2005-01-19 Restored builtin names which were overridden (min, max,
           abs, round, and sum) in pylab.  This is a potentially
           significant change for those who were relying on an array
           version of those functions that previously overrode builtin
           function names. - ADS

2005-01-18 Added accents to mathtext: \hat, \breve, \grave, \bar,
           \acute, \tilde, \vec, \dot, \ddot.  All of them have the
           same syntax, eg to make an overbar you do \bar{o} or to
           make an o umlaut you do \ddot{o}. The shortcuts are also
           provided, eg: \"o \'e \`e \~n \.x \^y - JDH

2005-01-18 Plugged image resize memory leaks - JDH

2005-01-18 Fixed some mathtext parser problems relating to superscripts

2005-01-17 Fixed a yticklabel problem for colorbars under change of
           clim - JDH

2005-01-17 Cleaned up Destroy handling in wx reducing memleak/fig from
           approx 800k to approx 6k- JDH

2005-01-17 Added kappa to latex_to_bakoma - JDH

2005-01-15 Support arbitrary colorbar axes and horizontal colorbars - JDH

       matures - SC

2005-01-15 Added Nadia's x,y contour fix

2005-01-12 Fixed set clip_on bug in artist - JDH

2005-01-11 Reverted pythoninspect in tkagg - JDH

2005-01-09 Fixed a backend_bases event bug caused when an event is
           triggered when location is None - JDH

2005-01-07 Add patch from Stephen Walton to fix bug in pylab.load()
           when the % character is included in a comment. - ADS

           the marker size in the legend to be adjusted relative to
           that in the plot. - ADS

2005-01-06 Add patch from Ben Vanhaeren to make the FigureManagerGTK vbox a
           public attribute - SC

====================================================================
2004-12-30 Release 0.70

2004-12-28 Added coord location to key press and added a
           examples/picker_demo.py

2004-12-28 Fixed coords notification in wx toolbar - JDH

2004-12-28 Moved connection and disconnection event handling to the
           FigureCanvasBase.  Backends now only need to connect one
           time for each of the button press, button release and key
           press/release functions.  The base class deals with
           callbacks and multiple connections.  This fixes flakiness
           on some backends (tk, wx) in the presence of multiple
           connections and/or disconnect - JDH

2004-12-27 Fixed PS mathtext bug where color was not set - Jochen
           please verify correct - JDH

2004-12-23 Fixed an agg text rotation alignment bug, fixed some text
           kwarg processing bugs, and added examples/text_rotation.py
           to explain and demonstrate how text rotations and alignment
           work in matplotlib. - JDH

======================================================================

2004-12-22 0.65.1 released - JDH

2004-12-22 Fixed colorbar bug which caused colorbar not to respond to
           changes in colormap in some instances - JDH

2004-12-22 Refactored NavigationToolbar in tkagg to support app
           embedding , init now takes (canvas, window) rather than
           (canvas, figman) - JDH

2004-12-21 Refactored axes and subplot management - removed
           add_subplot and add_axes from the FigureManager.  classic
           toolbar updates are done via an observer pattern on the
           figure using add_axobserver.  Figure now maintains the axes
           stack (for gca) and supports axes deletion.  Ported changes
           to GTK, Tk, Wx, and FLTK.  Please test!  Added delaxes - JDH

2004-12-21 Lots of image optimizations - 4x performance boost over
           0.65 JDH

2004-12-20 Fixed a figimage bug where the axes is shown and modified
           tkagg to move the destroy binding into the show method.

2004-12-18 Minor refactoring of NavigationToolbar2 to support
           embedding in an application - JDH

2004-12-14 Added linestyle to collections (currently broken) -  JDH

2004-12-14 Applied Nadia's setupext patch to fix libstdc++ link
           problem with contour and solaris  -JDH

2004-12-14 A number of pychecker inspired fixes, including removal of
           True and False from cbook which I erroneously thought was
           needed for python2.2 - JDH

2004-12-14 Finished porting doc strings for set introspection.
           Used silent_list for many get funcs that return
           lists. JDH

2004-12-13 dates.py: removed all timezone() calls, except for UTC - SC

======================================================================

2004-12-13 0.65 released - JDH

2004-12-13 colors.py: rgb2hex(), hex2color() made simpler (and faster), also
           rgb2hex() - added round() instead of integer truncation
           hex2color() - changed 256.0 divisor to 255.0, so now
           '#ffffff' becomes (1.0,1.0,1.0) not (0.996,0.996,0.996) - SC

2004-12-11 Added ion and ioff to pylab interface - JDH

2004-12-11 backend_template.py: delete FigureCanvasTemplate.realize() - most
           backends don't use it and its no longer needed

           backend_ps.py, backend_svg.py: delete show() and
           draw_if_interactive() - they are not needed for image backends

           backend_svg.py: write direct to file instead of StringIO
           - SC

2004-12-10 Added zorder to artists to control drawing order of lines,
           patches and text in axes.  See examples/zoder_demo.py - JDH

2004-12-10 Fixed colorbar bug with scatter - JDH

2004-12-10 Added Nadia Dencheva <dencheva@stsci.edu> contour code - JDH

2004-12-10 backend_cairo.py: got mathtext working - SC

2004-12-09 Added Norm Peterson's svg clipping patch

2004-12-09 Added Matthew Newville's wx printing patch

2004-12-09 Migrated matlab to pylab - JDH

2004-12-09 backend_gtk.py: split into two parts
           - backend_gdk.py - an image backend
           - backend_gtk.py - A GUI backend that uses GDK - SC

2004-12-08 backend_gtk.py: remove quit_after_print_xvfb(*args), show_xvfb(),
       Dialog_MeasureTool(gtk.Dialog) one month after sending mail to
           matplotlib-users asking if anyone still uses these functions - SC

2004-12-02 backend_bases.py, backend_template.py: updated some of the method
           documentation to make them consistent with each other - SC

2004-12-04 Fixed multiple bindings per event for TkAgg mpl_connect and
    mpl_disconnect.  Added a "test_disconnect" command line
    parameter to coords_demo.py  JTM

2004-12-04 Fixed some legend bugs JDH

2004-11-30 Added over command for oneoff over plots.  Eg over(plot, x,
           y, lw=2).  Works with any plot function.

2004-11-30 Added bbox property to text - JDH

2004-11-29 Zoom to rect now respect reversed axes limits (for both
           linear and log axes). - GL

2004-11-29 Added the over command to the matlab interface.  over
           allows you to add an overlay plot regardless of hold
       state. - JDH

2004-11-25 Added Printf to mplutils for printf style format string
           formatting in C++ (should help write better exceptions)

           set_and_get.py

2004-11-23 applied Norbert's patched and exposed legend configuration
           to kwargs - JDH

2004-11-23 backend_gtk.py: added a default exception handler - SC

2004-11-18 backend_gtk.py: change so that the backend knows about all image
           formats and does not need to use IMAGE_FORMAT in other backends - SC

2004-11-18 Fixed some report_error bugs in string interpolation as
           reported on SF bug tracker- JDH

2004-11-17 backend_gtkcairo.py: change so all print_figure() calls render using
           Cairo and get saved using backend_gtk.print_figure() - SC

2004-11-13 backend_cairo.py: Discovered the magic number (96) required for
       Cairo PS plots to come out the right size. Restored Cairo PS output
       and added support for landscape mode - SC

2004-11-13 Added ishold - JDH

2004-11-12 Added many new matlab colormaps - autumn bone cool copper
      flag gray hot hsv jet pink prism spring summer winter - PG

2004-11-09 backend_gtk.py: Made fix suggested by maffew@cat.org.au
       to prevent problems when py2exe calls pygtk.require(). - SC

2004-11-09 backend_cairo.py: Added support for printing to a fileobject.
           Disabled cairo PS output which is not working correctly. - SC

==============================================================
2004-11-08 matplotlib-0.64 released

2004-11-04 Changed -dbackend processing to only use known backends, so
           we don't clobber other non-matplotlib uses of -d, like -debug.

2004-11-04 backend_agg.py: added IMAGE_FORMAT to list the formats that the
           backend can save to.
           backend_gtkagg.py: added support for saving JPG files by using the
           GTK backend - SC

2004-10-31 backend_cairo.py: now produces png and ps files (although the figure
           sizing needs some work). pycairo did not wrap all the necessary
           functions, so I wrapped them myself, they are included in the
           backend_cairo.py doc string. - SC

2004-10-31 backend_ps.py: clean up the generated PostScript code, use
           the PostScript stack to hold itermediate values instead of
           storing them in the dictionary. - JV

2004-10-30 backend_ps.py, ft2font.cpp, ft2font.h: fix the position of
           text in the PostScript output.  The new FT2Font method
           get_descent gives the distance between the lower edge of
           the bounding box and the baseline of a string.  In
           backend_ps the text is shifted upwards by this amount. - JV

2004-10-30 backend_ps.py: clean up the code a lot.  Change the
           PostScript output to be more DSC compliant.  All
           definitions for the generated PostScript are now in a
           PostScript dictionary 'mpldict'.  Moved the long comment
           about drawing ellipses from the PostScript output into a
           Python comment. - JV

2004-10-30 backend_gtk.py: removed FigureCanvasGTK.realize() as its no longer
           needed. Merged ColorManager into GraphicsContext
           backend_bases.py: For set_capstyle/joinstyle() only set cap or
           joinstyle if there is no error. - SC

2004-10-30 backend_gtk.py: tidied up print_figure() and removed some of the
           dependency on widget events - SC

2004-10-28 backend_cairo.py: The renderer is complete except for mathtext,
           draw_image() and clipping. gtkcairo works reasonably well. cairo
           does not yet create any files since I can't figure how to set the
           'target surface', I don't think pycairo wraps the required functions
       - SC

2004-10-28 backend_gtk.py: Improved the save dialog (GTK 2.4 only) so it
           presents the user with a menu of supported image formats - SC

2004-10-28 backend_svg.py: change print_figure() to restore original face/edge
           color
           backend_ps.py : change print_figure() to ensure original face/edge
           colors are restored even if there's an IOError - SC

2004-10-27 Applied Norbert's errorbar patch to support barsabove kwarg

2004-10-27 Applied Norbert's legend patch to support None handles

2004-10-27 Added two more backends: backend_cairo.py, backend_gtkcairo.py
           They are not complete yet, currently backend_gtkcairo just renders
           polygons, rectangles and lines - SC

2004-10-21 Added polar axes and plots - JDH

2004-10-20 Fixed corrcoef bug exposed by corrcoef(X) where X is matrix
           - JDH

           text properties -- thanks to T. Edward Whalen for the suggestion

2004-10-19 Added support for PIL images in imshow(), image.py - ADS

2004-10-19 Re-worked exception handling in _image.py and _transforms.py
           to avoid masking problems with shared libraries.  - JTM

2004-10-16 Streamlined the matlab interface wrapper, removed the
           noplot option to hist - just use mlab.hist instead.

2004-09-30 Added Andrew Dalke's strftime code to extend the range of
           dates supported by the DateFormatter - JDH

2004-09-30 Added barh - JDH

2004-09-30 Removed fallback to alternate array package from numerix
           so that ImportErrors are easier to debug.           JTM

2004-09-24 Fixed axes resize image edge effects on interpolation -
           required upgrade to agg22 which fixed an agg bug related to
           this problem

2004-09-20 Added toolbar2 message display for backend_tkagg.  JTM


2004-09-17 Added coords formatter attributes.  These must be callable,
           and return a string for the x or y data. These will be used
           to format the x and y data for the coords box.  Default is
           the axis major formatter.  Eg

         # format the coords message box
         def price(x): return '$%1.2f'%x
         ax.format_xdata = DateFormatter('%Y-%m-%d')
         ax.format_ydata = price


2004-09-17 Total rewrite of dates handling to use python datetime with
           num2date, date2num and drange.  pytz for timezone handling,
           dateutils for spohisticated ticking.  date ranges from
           0001-9999 are supported.  rrules allow arbitrary date
           ticking.  examples/date_demo*.py converted to show new
           usage.  new example examples/date_demo_rrule.py shows how
           to use rrules in date plots.  The date locators are much
           more general and almost all of them have different
           constructors.  See matplotlib.dates for more info.

2004-09-15 Applied Fernando's backend __init__ patch to support easier
           backend maintenance.  Added his numutils to mlab.  JDH

2004-09-16 Re-designated all files in matplotlib/images as binary and
       w/o keyword substitution using "cvs admin -kb *.svg ...".
       See binary files in "info cvs" under Linux.  This was messing
       up builds from CVS on windows since CVS was doing lf -> cr/lf
       and keyword substitution on the bitmaps.  - JTM

2004-09-15 Modified setup to build array-package-specific extensions
       for those extensions which are array-aware.  Setup builds
       extensions automatically for either Numeric, numarray, or
       both, depending on what you have installed.  Python proxy
       modules for the array-aware extensions import the version
       optimized for numarray or Numeric determined by numerix.
           - JTM

2004-09-15 Moved definitions of infinity from mlab to numerix to avoid
       divide by zero warnings for numarray - JTM

2004-05-14 On second thought... created an "nx" namespace in
       in numerix which maps type names onto typecodes
       the same way for both numarray and Numeric.  This
       undoes my previous change immediately below. To get a
       typename for Int16 useable in a Numeric extension:
       say nx.Int16. - JTM

2004-05-15 Rewrote transformation class in extension code, simplified
           all the artist constructors - JDH

2004-05-14 Modified the type definitions in the numarray side of

--------------------------------------------
This is the Old, stale, never used changelog

2002-12-10 - Added a TODO file and CHANGELOG.  Lots to do -- get
             crackin'!

           - Fixed y zoom tool bug

           - Adopted a compromise fix for the y data clipping problem.
             The problem was that for solid lines, the y data clipping
             (as opposed to the gc clipping) caused artifactual
             horizontal solid lines near the ylim boundaries.  I did a
             5% offset hack in Axes set_ylim functions which helped,
             but didn't cure the problem for very high gain y zooms.
             So I disabled y data clipping for connected lines .  If
             you need extensive y clipping, either plot(y,x) because x
             data clipping is always enabled, or change the _set_clip
             code to 'if 1' as indicated in the lines.py src.  See
             _set_clip in lines.py and set_ylim in figure.py for more
             information.


2002-12-11 - Added a measurement dialog to the figure window to
             measure axes position and the delta x delta y with a left
             mouse drag.  These defaults can be overridden by deriving
             from Figure and overrriding button_press_event,
             button_release_event, and motion_notify_event,
             and _dialog_measure_tool.

           - fixed the navigation dialog so you can check the axes the
             navigation buttons apply to.



2003-04-23 Released matplotlib v0.1

2003-04-24 Added a new line style PixelLine2D which is the plots the
           markers as pixels (as small as possible) with format
           symbol ','

           Added a new class Patch with derived classes Rectangle,
           RegularPolygon and Circle

2003-04-25 Implemented new functions errorbar, scatter and hist

           Added a new line type '|' which is a vline.  syntax is
       plot(x, Y, '|') where y.shape = len(x),2 and each row gives
       the ymin,ymax for the respective values of x.  Previously I
       had implemented vlines as a list of lines, but I needed the
       efficientcy of the numeric clipping for large numbers of
       vlines outside the viewport, so I wrote a dedicated class
       Vline2D which derives from Line2D


2003-05-01

   Fixed ytick bug where grid and tick show outside axis viewport with gc clip

2003-05-14

   Added new ways to specify colors 1) matlab format string 2)
   html-style hex string, 3) rgb tuple.  See examples/color_demo.py

2003-05-28

    Changed figure rendering to draw form a pixmap to reduce flicker.
    See examples/system_monitor.py for an example where the plot is
    continusouly updated w/o flicker.  This example is meant to
    simulate a system monitor that shows free CPU, RAM, etc...

2003-08-04

    Added Jon Anderson's GTK shell, which doesn't require pygtk to
    have threading built-in and looks nice!

2003-08-25

   Fixed deprecation warnings for python2.3 and pygtk-1.99.18

2003-08-26

   Added figure text with new example examples/figtext.py


2003-08-27

   Fixed bugs i figure text with font override dictionairies and fig
   text that was placed outside the window bounding box

2003-09-1 thru 2003-09-15

   Added a postscript and a GD module backend

2003-09-16

   Fixed font scaling and point scaling so circles, squares, etc on
   lines will scale with DPI as will fonts.  Font scaling is not fully
   implemented on the gtk backend because I have not figured out how
   to scale fonts to arbitrary sizes with GTK

2003-09-17

   Fixed figure text bug which crashed X windows on long figure text
   extending beyond display area.  This was, I believe, due to the
   vestigial erase functionality that was no longer needed since I
   began rendering to a pixmap

2003-09-30  Added legend

2003-10-01 Fixed bug when colors are specified with rgb tuple or hex
   string.


2003-10-21  Andrew Straw provided some legend code which I modified
      and incorporated.  Thanks Andrew!

2003-10-27 Fixed a bug in axis.get_view_distance that affected zoom in
  versus out with interactive scrolling, and a bug in the axis text
  reset system that prevented the text from being redrawn on a
  interactive gtk view lim set with the widget

  Fixed a bug in that prevented the manual setting of ticklabel
  strings from working properly

2003-11-02 - Do a nearest neighbor color pick on GD when
             allocate fails

2003-11-02
   - Added pcolor plot
   - Added MRI example
   - Fixed bug that screwed up label position if xticks or yticks were
     empty
   - added nearest neighbor color picker when GD max colors exceeded
   - fixed figure background color bug in GD backend

2003-11-10 - 2003-11-11
   - major refactoring.
     * Ticks (with labels, lines and grid) handled by dedicated class
     * Artist now know bounding box and dpi
     * Bounding boxes and transforms handled by dedicated classes
     * legend in dedicated class.  Does a better job of alignment and
       bordering.  Can be initialized with specific line instances.
       See examples/legend_demo2.py


2003-11-14 Fixed legend positioning bug and added new position args

2003-11-16 Finsihed porting GD to new axes API


2003-11-20 - add TM for matlab on website and in docs


2003-11-20 - make a nice errorbar and scatter screenshot

2003-11-20 - auto line style cycling for multiple line types
   broken

2003-11-18 (using inkrect) :logical rect too big on gtk backend

2003-11-18 ticks don't reach edge of axes in gtk mode --
   rounding error?

2003-11-20 - port Gary's errorbar code to new API before 0.40

2003-11-20 - problem with stale _set_font.  legend axes box
   doesn't resize on save in GTK backend -- see htdocs legend_demo.py

2003-11-21 - make a dash-dot dict for the GC

2003-12-15 - fix install path bug
