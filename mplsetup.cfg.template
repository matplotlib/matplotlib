# Rename this file to mplsetup.cfg to modify Matplotlib's build options.

[libs]
# By default, Matplotlib builds with LTO, which may be slow if you re-compile
# often, and don't need the space saving/speedup.
#
#enable_lto = True
#
# By default, Matplotlib downloads and builds its own copies of FreeType and of
# Qhull.  You may set the following to True to instead link against a system
# FreeType/Qhull.  As an exception, Matplotlib defaults to the system version
# of FreeType on AIX.
#
#system_freetype = False
#system_qhull = False

[packages]
# Some of Matplotlib's components are optional: the MacOSX backend (installed
# by default on MacOSX; requires the Cocoa headers included with XCode), and
# the test data (i.e., the baseline image files; not installed by default).
# You can control whether they are installed by uncommenting the following
# lines.  Note that the MacOSX backend is never built on Linux or Windows,
# regardless of the config value.
#
#tests = False
#macosx = True

[rc_options]
# User-configurable options
#
# Default backend, one of: Agg, Cairo, GTK3Agg, GTK3Cairo, GTK4Agg, GTK4Cairo,
# MacOSX, Pdf, Ps, QtAgg, QtCairo, SVG, TkAgg, WX, WXAgg.
#
# The Agg, Ps, Pdf and SVG backends do not require external dependencies.  Do
# not choose MacOSX if you have disabled the relevant extension modules.  The
# default is determined by fallback.
#
#backend = Agg
