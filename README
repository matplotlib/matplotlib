INTRODUCTION:


   matplotlib is a pure python 2D plotting library with a Matlab(TM)
   syntax which produces publication quality figures using in a
   variety of hardcopy formats (PNG, JPG, TIFF, PS) and interactive
   GUI environments (WX, GTK) across platforms. matplotlib can be used
   in python scripts, interactively from the python shell (ala matlab
   or mathematica), in web application servers generating dynamic
   charts, or embedded in GTK or WX applications; see backends.

  matplotlib trys to make easy things easy and hard things
  possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar
  charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc, with just a few lines of
  code. For example, to make a histogram of data in x, you simply need
  to type

  >>> hist(x, 100)   # use 100 bins


  For the power user, you have full control of line styles, font
  properties, axes properties, etc, via an object oriented interface
  or via a handle graphics interface familiar to matlab users. A
  summary of the goals of matplotlib and the progress so far can be
  found at http://matplotlib.sf.net/goals.html.

REQUIREMENTS:

   python 2.3+, and numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/).  Other
   requirements are backend dependent.  See
   http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/backends.html.  If you are using
   python2.3, you'll also need to install setuptools; just download
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py and run it.

INSTALL

   The latest installation instructions can be found at

    http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/installing.html

  and for backend specific install information see
